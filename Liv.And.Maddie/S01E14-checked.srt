1
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:05,458
谢谢你帮我调整自行车弹簧了  帕克
Thanks for giving my bike a spring tune-up, Parker.

2
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:06,625
别客气  小哥
No problem, munch.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,427
我要确保能把你从这里带走的东西
I wanna make sure the thing that carries you

4
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:11,230
时时刻刻都能正常工作
away from here is working at all times.

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,400
好了  小伙子们  清场了
All right, boys, clear out.

6
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:18,204
校队垒球选拔赛快要到了  我们要用后院来练习
Varsity softball tryouts are coming up, and I need the backyard to practice.

7
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:21,207
别想了  玛蒂  我们可是先到这儿的
Forget it, Maddie. We were here first.

8
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,375
乔伊你好啊
Hi, Joey.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,376
我的天啊
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,447
整个后院就交给你了  玛蒂
Backyard is all yours, Maddie.

11
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:31,350
别急  我还没调整好呢
No, I wasn't finished!

12
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,291
整个后院就交给你了  玛蒂
The backyard's all yours, Maddie.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,431
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

14
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,366
不同的朋友
b... b... better in stereo

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,568
迎着清晨阳光
- I'm up with the sunshine - Let's go

16
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,637
穿上舒服衣裳
- I lace up my high tops - Oh no

17
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,572
扣篮  热热身
- slam dunk - Ready or not

18
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,441
秀出你的份量
yeah, show me what you got

19
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,410
站在舞台中央
- I’m under the spotlight - Holler

20
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,312
准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

21
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:02,581
你有你的节拍
you dance to your own beat

22
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:04,283
我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

23
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,585
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,521
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

25
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:10,289
你想停留
when you say stop

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,459
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go, go, go

27
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:16,462
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the other half of me, me

28
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:18,664
学不来的朋友
the half I'll never be-e

29
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:22,268
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

30
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:25,337
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the better half of me, me

31
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:27,506
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

32
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,441
你我有
but we both know

33
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:31,343
不或缺的朋友
we're better in stereo.

34
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,349
终于来了  终于来了
It's here! It's here.

35
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,584
我的未来终于来到了
My future is here.

36
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:40,319
我的未来就在这儿
My future is here!

37
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,254
夹在两片面包的中间
Between two slices of bread.

38
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,357
你的未来还早着呢
Your future can wait.

39
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,393
天啊
Look.

40
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,263
这不就是《太空狼人》里的道具服么
That's the costume from "space werewolves."

41
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:54,500
《太空狼人》可是一部一鸣惊人的动作电影
"Space werewolves" is a big action blockbuster

42
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:56,635
就像是下一部《暮光之城》一样
that's gonna be kind of like the next "twilight,"

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,572
除了主角是太空中的狼人而非地球上的吸血鬼
except it's werewolves in space instead of vampires on earth.

44
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,173
这个的可信度要高多了
It's way more believable.

45
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,543
所以  你得到了领衔主演的位置
So, you got the lead in the movie.

46
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,313
还没有  其实导演组认为一个姑娘看起来不够坚强
No. They actually don't think a girl will look tough enough.

47
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,315
所以你偷走了戏服
So you stole the suit

48
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,583
这样他们就拍不成电影了
so they can't make the movie.

49
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,518
你就这么心术不正啊
You are diabolical.

50
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,355
事实上  我跟他们说了要把狼人戏服寄给我
Actually, I talked them into sending me the werewolf suit

51
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,257
这样我就能拍照片来证明他们想错了
so I can take pictures in it to prove them wrong.

52
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,193
这样也成啊
That could work too.

53
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,528
我更喜欢心术不正的你
I like you better diabolical.

54
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,531
丽芙  大好消息
Liv, great news.

55
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:26,632
电视台第四频道刚打来电话
Channel four just called.

56
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,201
这周五他们要到咱家里
They're coming to the house this Friday

57
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,269
专门采访你
to interview you

58
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,504
来做他们的早间烹饪节目
for their morning news cooking segment.

59
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,407
我要上《尼比斯私房菜》了
I'm doing "Nibbling with Nimbus"?

60
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,376
对的 简直不敢相信
Yes. Can you believe it?

61
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,644
我爱死那个节目了
I love that segment.

62
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:43,582
上周  尼比斯和范·迪塞尔一起油炸了一只火鸡
Last week, nimbus deep fried a Turkey with Vin Diesel.
（范·迪塞尔：美国电影演员，制片人）

63
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,551
等等  妈妈  你刚刚说的是周五么
Wait, mom, did you say Friday?

64
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,555
又是《太空狼人》摄影
So a "space werewolves" movie photo shoot

65
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,390
又是一个直播电视访谈
and a live TV interview.

66
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:55,261
好了  这一周赶通告压力大咯
Okay, this is shaping up to be an oddly stressful week.

67
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:58,297
但是  幸亏你有一个超级酷的妈妈
Well, luckily you have a super-cool mom

68
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,367
还是一个可以帮你应付一切压力的治疗师
who's also a therapist. And she can help you manage your stress.

69
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,269
太好了  因为我马上需要你的帮助
Good. Because I am going to need your help

70
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,204
帮我挑出最上镜的那套衣服
picking out a TV-rrific outfit.

71
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,372
你需要我的时尚建议
You want my fashion advice.

72
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,173
天啊  这一天终于到来了
Oh, it's finally happening.

73
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,341
那好
Okay.

74
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,343
一件农妇衫
How about a peasant blouse

75
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,646
外加一条紧身裤怎么样
with some sensible trousers?

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,414
果然 找你要建议大错特错了
Yeah, this was a mistake.

77
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,487
绿带的学员们  掌握龙之真气
Green belts, the path of the dragon

78
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,188
绝非易事
is not easy.

79
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,593
嘿呀
Hyah!

80
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,528
别给吓趴下了
Do not be scared.

81
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,497
这苍蝇还活着  勉强算吧
The fly lives, barely.

82
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,266
我这么做的目的是杀鸡儆猴
But only so he can warn his friends

83
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,202
三心二意是绝对不可饶恕的
that distractions will not be tolerated.

84
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,507
天啊  蕾·道伊老师可不是闹着玩的
Wow, Sensei Rae Dawn is no joke.

85
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,209
我听说如果你直视她的眼睛
I heard if you look directly in her eyes,

86
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,346
她就能偷走你的灵魂
she can steal your soul.

87
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,348
小龙帕克
Dragon Parker,

88
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,683
你准备好通过释放出
are you ready to advance from green belt

89
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,217
你内在的龙之真气
to blue belt

90
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,485
来表演飞龙跳跃后空踢
by unleashing your inner dragon

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,488
把你的绿带升级为蓝带了吗
and performing the leaping dragon back-kick?

92
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:58,490
准备好了 老师
Ready, Sensei.

93
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,227
嘿呀
Hyah!

94
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,565
很令人钦佩 年轻的小龙
Impressive, young dragon.

95
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,301
这是你的蓝腰带
Your belt.

96
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:12,438
提醒一下你们的父母 新腰带价值 9.95 美元
Remind your parents it's 9.95 for the new belt

97
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,273
你踢烂的靶子价值 1.2 美元
and 1.20 for the target you broke.

98
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:19,345
小龙埃文
Dragon Evan,

99
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,447
- 你准备好  - 你先等等再说
- are you ready... - Let me stop you right there.

100
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,284
我妈说我今天还不能释放龙之真气
My mom says I can't unleash my dragon today.

101
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:26,485
什么
Excuse me?

102
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,188
她觉得我不能参加一个
She thinks I shouldn't participate in an activity

103
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,490
以成败评判小孩子的活动
where kids are judged in terms of winning or failing.

104
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,660
尤其是我失败已经板上钉钉了
Especially when I'm going to fail.

105
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,398
总之我今天能通过
Anyway I can get a blue belt

106
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,200
敞开心扉来促膝长谈
by being open about my feelings

107
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,634
而拿到蓝带么
and talking out issues?

108
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:48,240
看起来你内在的小龙更像是冒牌的蜥蜴啊
Seems your inner dragon is more of a salamander.

109
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,441
想拿腰带  没门
No belt for you.

110
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:52,344
你有一周时间来努力拿到蓝腰带
You have one week to earn your blue belt

111
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,381
要么就忍辱负重的看着班里其他人
or endure the shame of watching the rest of the class

112
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,549
挪到周二 2 点半的那节课
move on to the 2:30 Tuesday slot

113
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,418
就除了你
without you.

114
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,455
我绝对不能就这么让老师
There was no way I was gonna let the sensei

115
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,157
拆开我们
break up the team of

116
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,492
极品武术双人组
super-awesome martial arts dude

117
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,327
和他挚爱的老哥们
and his beloved sidekick,

118
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:12,331
雀斑  和嬉皮笑脸的冒牌蜥蜴
freckles, the smiling salamander.

119
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:13,432
耶
Yeah.

120
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:14,600
埃文也许要换一个新绰号了
Evan might need a new nickname.

121
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,504
好了  维罗  准备好了么
Okay, Willow, ready?

122
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:20,272
集中注意力  向我投球  就朝着这儿
Focus. Fire one at me. Right here.

123
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,177
太棒了
Perfect...

124
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,446
如果我们是在玩砸花盆的话
If we were playing "smash that pot."

125
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,284
维罗  你状态几天都不好了
Willow, you've been in a slump for days.

126
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,585
我只是不能全神贯注罢了
I just can't concentrate.

127
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,288
那好  垒球选拔赛就在这周末
Okay, well, softball tryouts are this weekend,

128
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,190
如果我们要成为校队里的首批二年级生的话
and if we want to be the first sophomores to make varsity,

129
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,291
你就必须得认真投入比赛
then you gotta get your head in the game.

130
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,427
你到底遇上什么问题了
What is your problem?

131
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,362
你知道吗  我一说起这事
You know what? I just don't feel comfortable

132
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:44,530
就浑身不舒服
talking about it.

133
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,231
那行  我们必须要趁着选拔赛前
Okay, well, we have to get to the bottom

134
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,200
把你所有的问题都消灭干净
of whatever this is before tryouts.

135
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,334
如果你不愿意和我聊天的话
And if you're not willing to talk to me,

136
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,536
也许我们就需要一些专业的帮助了
then maybe we need some professional help.

137
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,205
谁刚刚说了专业的帮助来着
Did someone say "professional help"?

138
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,342
这一天终于到来了
It is finally happening.

139
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,580
谢谢你们来到我的办公室见我
Thank you for seeing me in my office.

140
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:05,350
谢谢你开车带我们来
Thank you for the ride.

141
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:08,353
那是  我觉得在这了谈心会更加舒适
Well, I thought we would be more comfortable here.

142
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,456
而你们看见我所有的学历和证书时
And I thought you'd be more receptive to my words

143
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,191
也能更好的听进我的话
if you could see all my degrees.

144
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,428
总之  维罗不会投球了
So, Willow can't pitch.

145
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,363
对极了  治好她
Exactly. Fix her.

146
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,502
那么你就告诉我这幅罗夏测试图
So you tell me what is the first thing
（罗夏测试：通过墨迹图来反映被测者心理状况）

147
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:26,205
在你脑中最像什么
that pops into your head.
（墨迹图为左右对称，剧中测试方法不规范）

148
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,206
乔伊
Joey.

149
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,542
乔伊
Joey.

150
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,548
乔伊在骑一匹长得像乔伊的马
Joey on a horse that looks like Joey.

151
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,651
好了
Okay.

152
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,487
我看来要大胆推测
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

153
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,655
认定这其中肯定和乔伊
and say that this has something

154
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,656
有密不可分的联系
to do with Joey.

155
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,227
哇  你真在行
Wow, you're good.

156
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,630
乔伊
Joey?

157
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:52,664
这一切都是关于乔伊的
This whole thing is about Joey?

158
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,399
玛蒂  在这里我们要心平气和
Maddie, this is a safe place.

159
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:55,567
不要随意给别人下定论
We do not judge,

160
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,202
哪怕这是你脑中
even if it is the first place

161
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,370
第一个想去的地方
your brain wants to go.

162
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,441
那么你和乔伊到底是什么关系
Okay, so what is going on with you and Joey?

163
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,543
没任何关系  这就是症结了
Nothing. That's the problem.

164
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,246
正是春意盎然之时
It's springtime.

165
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,149
爱意弥漫在空中  鸟儿在枝头谈情说爱
Love is in the air, birds are chirping,

166
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,483
可我魂牵梦绕的一切就是
but all I can think about is

167
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:15,387
为何我的小乔伊不跟我谈情说爱啊
why doesn't my sweet little Joey bird chirp at me?

168
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:18,557
那到底乔伊和你的投球有什么关系
Okay, what... what does Joey have to do with your pitching?

169
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,193
我集中不了注意力
I can't concentrate.

170
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,395
当我投球时 我直视着你
When I pitch, I look directly at you.

171
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,165
- 对的  - 但我每次看你
- Right. - But every time I look at you,

172
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,533
脑中就浮现出乔伊
all I see is Joey.

173
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:31,403
我长得像乔伊  不可能
I look like Joey?! No, okay.

174
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,305
我们都戴眼镜
We both wear glasses,

175
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,341
可这就是唯一的相同点了  好不
but that is where the similarity ends, right?

176
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,442
对不
Right?!

177
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,379
所以你投球水平这么烂
So the reason you stink at pitching

178
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,413
责任在我头上
is because of me?

179
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,183
对  你们俩长得简直像极了
Yeah. You guys look exactly like each other.

180
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,317
只不过他才能打动我
Except he makes it work.

181
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,318
哦  太好了  你在这儿  我必须要找人聊聊
Oh, good, you're here. I really need to talk.

182
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,320
噢  我洗耳恭听
Oh, I'm all ears.

183
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,325
好的  维罗在低谷期  她投不了球
Okay, Willow's in a slump and she can't pitch,

184
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,460
这会让她进不了学校垒球队的
and that's gonna keep her from making varsity softball.

185
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,596
体育运动  我不在行
Sports.

186
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,735
但是她投不了球的原因
But the reason she can't pitch

187
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,670
是因为她无法全神贯注于任何事
is because she can't concentrate on anything

188
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,539
一心只有她对乔伊的疯狂迷恋
other than her massive crush on Joey.

189
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,275
哦  感情  这东西我在行
Ooh, feelings. Yay.

190
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,278
维罗是个好苗子
Willow's just so awesome,

191
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,614
我希望她能意识到大千世界除了乔伊以外
and I wish she would realize that there's so much more out there

192
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:28,350
还有无数的新鲜玩意等着被发掘
in the world for her other than just Joey.

193
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:32,320
那就让她看看大千世界的新鲜玩意啊
Okay, so make her see that there's more out there.

194
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,457
在她的储物柜里留一张匿名者的情书
Put a love note from a secret admirer

195
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:38,326
她就会把乔伊忘得一干二净的
in her locker, and she'll forget all about Joey.

196
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,695
丽芙  这个主意棒极了
Liv, that's actually a really good idea.

197
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,565
事实上  我还记得四年级时
Actually, I remember in fourth grade

198
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,700
当我沉湎于马基·斯蒂文而不能自拔时
when I was so obsessed with marky Stevens

199
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,303
我简直都玩不好儿童足球了
that I literally couldn't even play kickball.

200
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:51,306
之后我收到了一封匿名情书  写信的原来是
And then I got a secret admirer note from...

201
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,707
你
You.

202
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,312
之后谁在学校儿童足球赛
And who went on to win top prize

203
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,647
独占鳌头了啊
in the school kickball-y thing?

204
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,714
别说了  不用谢
Uh-huh, you're welcome.

205
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:08,523
- 你在干嘛呢  - 噢
- Whatcha doing? - Ooh!

206
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,461
别这么偷偷靠近我
Do not sneak up on me like that.

207
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,463
你在维罗的储物柜前干什么呢
What are you doing at Willow's locker?

208
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:18,500
更重要的是  我在维罗的储物柜前干什么呢
More importantly, what am I doing at Willow's locker?

209
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,435
那是一张留言条吗
Is that a note?

210
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,437
对  你千万别和任何人说
Yeah, actually, don't tell anyone,

211
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:23,672
但是我在帮我们俩一个忙
but I'm doing us both a favor.

212
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,273
这是一封匿名的情书
It's a secret admirer note

213
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,309
来帮维罗移情别恋
to get Willow to stop obsessing about you.

214
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,277
我希望你写好点
I hope you wrote a good one.

215
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,279
维罗犯的乔伊病已经病入膏肓了
Willow's got a bad case of the Joeys,

216
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,714
我还不确定有药能治好
and I'm not sure there's a cure.

217
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,620
唔  我脖子后边的汗毛立起来了
Hmm, the hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.

218
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,755
维罗要来了 快跑
Willow's coming. Run.

219
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:54,369
乔伊你好啊
Hey, Joey.

220
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:55,604
美女你好啊
Hey, beautiful.

221
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,441
这是什么
What's this?

222
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:05,313
有人喜欢我
Secret admirer?

223
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,715
哦不  不会吧
Oh-ho. No way.

224
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,550
看起来她相信了
It looks like she's buying it.

225
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,487
别学我这么站
Stop standing like me.

226
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,489
我们长得又不像
We do not look alike.

227
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,497
埃文  我知道你没拿到蓝带
Evan, I know you're disappointed

228
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:23,765
失望极了
that you didn't get your blue belt.

229
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,500
说实话  我挺好的
Actually, I'm cool.

230
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,636
我会把它看做我人生旅途的一部分
I've accepted it as a part of life's journey.

231
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,738
得了吧  埃文  我们是一队的
Come on, Evan. We're a team.

232
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:31,473
你不可能是这么想的
That can't be how you really feel.

233
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,608
你说对了  是我妈让我这么说的
You're right. My mom told me to say that.

234
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,611
你想象不到我以前都把什么看做了
You wouldn't believe the things I've accepted

235
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,514
人生旅途的一部分
as part of life's journey.

236
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,416
但我真的很想拿到蓝腰带
But I really do want my blue belt.

237
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,752
那我们就要释放出你的龙之真气
Then we've got to unleash your inner dragon.

238
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,353
你也听见老师这么讲了
You heard the sensei.

239
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,488
如果你下节课之前
If you don't become a blue belt

240
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,357
拿不到蓝带的话  我们就要甩下你调课了
by our next class, we move on without you.

241
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:50,559
嘿  别因为我水平差劲
Hey, just because I stink

242
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,494
就以为我听不懂人话
doesn't mean I don't understand English.

243
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,365
我们要让你足够愤怒
We are gonna get you angry enough

244
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,635
来释放你积攒已久的龙气
to release all your pent up inner aggression.

245
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,471
这是你妈让你带着的
This is the new balance plate lunchbox

246
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,473
营养均衡板午餐盒  对吗
your mom made you get, right?

247
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,709
但你想不想要酷到让人大跌眼镜的
But didn't you want the cool ufc lunchbox

248
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,612
终极格斗赛特款午餐盒呢
with the dude's eyeball falling out?

249
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,547
我妈认为那种太暴力了
My mom thought it was too violent.

250
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,784
再说了  这款有个胡萝卜暖瓶呢
Plus, this one had a carrot thermos.

251
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,487
埃文  如果你想要格斗锦标赛午餐盒
Evan, if you want that cool ufc lunchbox,

252
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,556
你就得把营养均衡饭盒砸了
you need to smash the balance plate.

253
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:24,593
来吧  伙计  深吸一口气再呼出点火苗来
Come on, dude. Reach down deep and breathe some fire.

254
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,633
你知道的  我还是别这么做了
You know, I better not.

255
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:34,469
我妈说如果我不把它带回家
Mom says if I don't bring it home,

256
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:35,604
我就吃不到甜品了
I don't get my dessert.

257
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,372
而你是知道我多喜欢生杏仁的
And you know how I love raw almonds.

258
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,510
丽芙  准备好《太空狼人》摄影了吗
Liv, you ready for your "space werewolves" photo shoot?

259
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:49,384
退后  愚蠢的人类  不然就尝尝我愤怒的滋味吧
Stand back, humanoid, or feel my fury.

260
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,522
哇  你看起来帅呆了
Whoa. You look awesome.

261
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,358
谢了  爸爸
Thanks, dad.

262
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:58,360
我们开始吧
Now let's do this.

263
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:02,397
咆哮
Snarl.

264
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,465
嚎叫
Growl.

265
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,467
再狂吠
Howl.

266
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,669
让我见识见识你的凶猛
Show me fierce.

267
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:09,437
砰  啪  咋样
Boom, pow, Wha-cha!

268
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:14,442
不
No!

269
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,444
爸  他们送来粘盔甲的胶水
Dad, the armor glue they sent me

270
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,679
应该是永久有效的啊
said it's supposed to be permanent.

271
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,315
别担心  趁你衣服没散架之前
Don't worry. I got some fantastic shots

272
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,449
我拍了几张顶好的照片
before your suit fell apart.

273
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,652
哦  太好了  这张真不错
Oh, great. That one's perfect.

274
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:25,654
现在我可以把痒痒的耳朵摘下来了
Now I can take these itchy ears off.

275
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:29,658
嗷
Ow.

276
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,660
它们卡住了
They're stuck.

277
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,495
噢 好吧 我的獠牙也卡住了
Oh, okay. So are my fangs.

278
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,566
真是奇怪
That's so weird.

279
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:39,734
他们送来的化妆胶水
The makeup glue that they sent me

280
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,703
写着说只有20分钟有效
says it's only supposed to last 20 minutes.

281
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:46,708
而粘盔甲的胶水写的是“永久有效”
And the armor glue says "permanent."

282
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,354
嘿  小玛
Hey, mads.

283
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,356
今天天气真不错啊
What a beautiful day.

284
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,291
我看见了心形的云朵
I see heart shapes in the clouds,

285
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,594
和闻起来像茉莉和热狗的空气
and the air smells like Jasmine and hot dogs.

286
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,433
我得到了一张匿名情书
I got a note from a secret admirer.

287
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,401
你真得到了
You did?

288
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,639
哇  刚才那真不是我们的风格
Wow, that's totally unlike us.

289
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,708
对  以后再也别这么做了
Yeah, let's please never do that again.

290
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,579
但是我不能不说我很吃惊
But I can't really say I'm surprised.

291
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:26,314
你这么一个顶尖的女孩
You are a top-notch lady

292
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,483
是每个男生都梦寐以求的
who any guy would be lucky to have.

293
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,752
现在就为进校队而努力吧
Now let's get us on that varsity squad.

294
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,788
把我的手打成肉酱吧
Turn my hand into a bloody pulp.

295
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,759
暗恋我的人是乔伊·鲁尼
My secret admirer is Joey Rooney.

296
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,428
我的小乔伊终于要和我谈情说爱了啊
My little Joey bird finally chirped back!

297
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,765
等等  乔伊
Wait, Joey?

298
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,600
那封情书和乔伊没有半点瓜葛
There was nothing in that note about Joey...

299
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,704
我这么说是因为那是匿名信嘛
I'm assuming because you said it was a secret.

300
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,608
好几个礼拜以来
For the first time in weeks,

301
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,411
我的思想终于清晰了  我能全神贯注了
my mind is clear and I can concentrate.

302
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,346
我是说  那明显是乔伊写的  对不
I mean, it's obviously Joey, right?

303
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,282
好吧  我知道我应该有权解释清楚
Okay, so I know I should have come clean

304
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,550
来保护我的哥哥
right then and there to protect my brother

305
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:07,422
和我最好的朋友的  但我的理由是
and my best friend, but in my defense...

306
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,423
好吧  我没啥可说的
Yeah, okay. I got nothing.

307
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,293
当然了  对的
Sure. Yeah.

308
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,728
怎么可能不是呢
Why not?

309
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:17,365
重点是你终于走出低谷了
The point is that you are out of your slump

310
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,335
现在我们能为选拔赛做准备了
and now we can get you ready for tryouts.

311
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,669
等下  这个嘛
Yeah, about that.

312
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:23,404
我以后不打垒球了
I'm quitting softball.

313
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,306
什么
What?!

314
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,574
维罗  你不能这么做
Willow, you can't.

315
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,643
情感是要耗工夫的
Relationships take work.

316
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:29,778
我和乔伊的情感发展
This thing I have going on with Joey

317
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:31,446
必须成为我的第一要务
has to be my top priority.

318
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,516
等会见了  小玛
See you later, mads,

319
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,351
如果我还能站定的话
if I ever come back down to earth.

320
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,321
哇
Wow.

321
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,490
看来她的乔伊病真的无药可治了
There really is no cure for a bad case of the Joeys.

322
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:53,368
年轻的小龙们  在我们给落后的埃文
Young dragons, before we give the weak link

323
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:56,638
最后一次赢得蓝腰带
known as Evan his final chance

324
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:58,373
的机会之前
to earn his blue belt,

325
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:02,243
花几分钟来喂饱你们内心中的猛龙吧
take a few moments to feed your inner dragons.

326
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,647
拜托这是零食时间  配合我一下好不
It's snack time. Work with me here.

327
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:09,417
我本打算放弃他  开始找一个新死党
I was about to give up and look for a new sidekick

328
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,486
但当我想起有一次埃文只是因为他妈妈给了他
when I remembered the time Evan lost it

329
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,555
海苔片而严重暴走
because his mom gave him seaweed chips.

330
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,557
所以我就把他的生杏仁
So I swapped out his raw almonds

331
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,559
都换成了恶心的水草
for some of that disgusting water weed.

332
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:24,232
至少我们还能最后一次在一起吃零食啊
At least we get to have snack together one last time.

333
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,567
你准备好吃零食了么
Are you ready for your snack?

334
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:26,701
你也该吃零食了吧
You should have your snack.

335
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:32,607
- 我其实还没那么  - 我说了让你吃零食
- I'm not really that... - I said eat your snack.

336
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,346
我不敢相信啊
I can't believe this!

337
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
怎么了啊
What's wrong?

338
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:40,615
居然是海苔片
It's seaweed chips!

339
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,318
新鲜的  有机的  海苔片
Unsalted, organic, seaweed chips.

340
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,619
我一直跟我妈说我恨死海苔片了
I keep telling my mom I hate them.

341
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,588
给我萝卜条或者芹菜
Give me carrot sticks or celery

342
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:50,358
哪怕是高丽菜也好  偏偏是海苔片
or even rutabaga, just not seaweed chips!

343
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,527
得了吧  哥们
Come on, dude.

344
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,330
听妈妈的话把它吃掉咯
Listen to your mom and eat it!

345
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,432
打死我也不吃海苔
I won't eat seaweed!

346
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,607
怎么了  看什么看
What, what?!

347
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,215
我真是个好朋友啊
I'm a good friend.

348
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:17,652
谁还想尝尝我的厉害
Who else wants some?

349
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,623
小龙埃文  这就是你的龙气啊
Dragon Evan, that was your inner dragon.

350
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,391
它被释放出来了
It's been released!

351
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:26,227
你已经准备好系上蓝腰带了
You are ready for your blue belt now.

352
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,463
太棒了  埃文  你成功了
Yes! Evan, you did it.

353
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,465
你小子别跟我讲废话
Tell me something that I don't know.

354
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,635
别被我甩下了  小子
Try to keep up, munch.

355
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,409
早上好  史蒂文斯波因特的观众朋友们

欢迎来到《尼比斯私房菜》

359
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,487
最吸引人的住户或者游客做一顿早餐
for one of Stevens point's most intriguing residents or visitors.

360
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:54,656
而这周 除了美味的早餐
And this week, we got a tasty combination

361
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,424
我们还请到了
of breakfast brats

362
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,259
《放声歌唱》里的丽芙·鲁尼
and the always flavorful star

363
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,528
这个组合是不是会回味无穷呢
of “Sing Ot Loud," Liv Rooney.

364
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,198
我努力了整个晚上
I tried all night

365
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,200
来把我的狼耳朵和獠牙取下来
to get my ears and my fangs off.

366
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,303
它们固若金汤啊  我试着取消采访
They wouldn't budge. I tried cancelling

367
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,538
但是强尼·尼比斯还是准时出现了
and Johnny nimbus showed up anyway.

368
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,207
所以我做了任何好演员都会做的事
So I did what any great actress would do.

369
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,209
我把我歪瓜裂枣的地方都用戏服与道具藏好了
I hid my flaws with wardrobe and props.

370
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,379
现在出场的这位就是她了
Live and in person, here she is now.

371
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,221
哇  丽芙·鲁尼  这身行头不错啊
Wow, Liv Rooney, that is a nice getup.

372
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,257
告诉我  这几天孩子们都穿的像你一样么
Tell me, is that what all the kids are wearing these days?

373
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,560
若不是的话  看完节目他们就会了
'Cause if not, they will be after watching this.

374
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,695
啊  我在扯什么呢
Ah, who am I kidding?

375
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,530
我们的节目是没有孩子看的
No kids are watching this program.

376
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,668
强尼  你真是可爱啊
Johnny, you are adorable.

377
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:43,571
告诉我们  你今早要做什么呢
So tell us, what are you cooking up this morning?

378
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,240
好的  我会用平底锅来烤香肠
Well, I got a griddle full of brats

379
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,643
还要用与你加深了解做配菜
and a side order of get to know you.

380
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,244
哈
Huh?

381

很好 现在准备做水煎蛋了
Okay, now these eggs are ready for poaching.

382
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,249
这里分享一个从俺奶奶那儿学到的小窍门
And here's a secret I learned from Nana nimbus.

383
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,252
不要用水来煎  改用清鸡汤吧
Don't use water. Use chicken broth instead.

384
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,287
丽芙·鲁尼  你能帮我开一下么
Liv Rooney, could you open that for me.

385
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:00,388
- 好的  - 好极了
- Mm-hmm. - All right.

386
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,630
开好了 强尼
Here you go, Johnny.

387
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:11,532
哇 速度真快
Wow! That was quick.

388
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,268
很好  现在开始煎蛋了
All right. Now get poaching.

389
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,370
很不错
There you go.

390
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,205
就只要随意的把鸡汤倒进去
Just liberally putting it in there.

391
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,406
做好了就会非常美味的
They're gonna taste great.

392
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,274
很好 现在
Okay. Now.

393
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,576
来坐到桌前侃侃大山吧
Let's sit down to chew the fat.

394
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,244
照字面意思讲
And I mean that literally.

395
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,645
这些烤香肠九成都是脂肪
These brats are 90% fat.

396
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:30,585
快来吧 丽芙
Well, come on, Liv.

快来把你的牙深深地咬进
Come on over and sink your teeth

这些烤香肠里
into one of these babies.

399
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,358

400
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:39,227
噢  丽芙  我来拉你起来
Oh, Liv, here. Let me help you up.

401
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:40,428
我的老天爷啊
Here... oh!

402
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,264
是我被咖啡灌糊涂了
Either I've had too much coffee,

403
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,499
还是狼人是真的
or werewolves are real!

404
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:50,405
呃
Um...

405
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,473
呃  没有啦  事实上  强尼
Uh, no. Actually, Johnny,

406
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:57,412
我只是给你们电视四台一个独家新闻
I am just giving you a channel four exclusive.

407
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:01,516
我将会成为《太空狼人》的主演
I am up for the lead in "space werewolves,"

408
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,185
所以为了让粉丝们小激动一下

409
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,355
我决定让你们先睹为快一下
I decided that I would give you a little sneak peek.

410
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:08,423
哦
Oh!

411
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:11,526
说实话
Seriously.

412
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,593
你差点把我吓尿了
You're kind of freaking me out.

413
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,301
嘿  维罗收到那张字条了么
Hey, did Willow get the note?

414

- Well, yeah, she was... - shh shh shh shh.

00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,409
我只要知道她不会再粘着我了就好
All I needed to know is that she's off my scent.

417
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:30,244
你干的太漂亮了
You have served your purpose.

418
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,479
嘿  维罗
Hey, Willow.

00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:42,323
我打赌你挺兴奋的吧  哈
I bet you're pretty excited about that, huh?

423
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,592
我就说追随着彩虹总会发现你心所属的嘛
I say chase this rainbow and see where it takes you.

00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:56,237
我实在是憋不住了
I just can't take it anymore.

乔伊·鲁尼暗恋着我
Joey Rooney's my secret admirer!

430
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,646
到底发生什么了
What is happening?

431
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:08,583
哎呀

432
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,651
呃 我想我们仨最好
Uh, I think it's best that the three of us

433

找个安全的地方解释清楚吧

434
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:16,591
维罗

你可以放下他了
You can put him down now.

436
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,598

00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,699
这感觉太美好了
It just feels so right.

狠狠地处罚玛蒂吧  妈妈

我不想让我最好的朋友
I didn't want to see my best friend

450
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,729
整天对着一个傻小子神魂颠倒
drive herself crazy over some stupid guy.

451
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:59,700
呃  那个傻小子就坐在这儿呢

谢谢  玛蒂  但你不应该插手这件事
Thanks, Maddie, but you shouldn't have interfered.

458
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,452
你不会真的不打垒球了吧  对吗

459

不会的  你说得对
No, you're right.

460
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,390
我们要冲校队名额了
We're making varsity.

461
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,726
我不应该对一个傻小子牵挂这么久的

又来  我在这儿呢

463
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,301
所以玛蒂  你有什么想对你弟弟说的吗
So Maddie, is there anything you would like to say to your brother?

465
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,672
今早是你吃了最后那块松饼吗
Did you eat the last muffin this morning?

466
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:39,373
玛蒂
Maddie.

467
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,612
呃  我不应该让维罗
Uh... I should not have let

468
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,547
咬定了你暗恋她
Willow think that you were her secret admirer.

469
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,282
对极了
Exactly.

470
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:49,417
我和维罗彼此之间的感情问题
How Willow and I feel about each other

471
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,518
不关你任何事
is none of your business.

472
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:53,754
噢  不
Oh, no.

473
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,358
乔伊刚刚说了我们之间
Joey just said he and I had feelings...

对彼此有感情啊
About each other.

475
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,296
呃  不对
Um, no.

476
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:05,566
我的意思是  我先走了算了
What I meant was... I'm going now.

477
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,438
顺便  玛蒂  最后一块松饼是我吃的
And Maddie, I did eat that muffin.

478
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:18,479
把我藏好
Hide me!

479
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,484
我把埃文的龙之真气逼出来了
I unleashed Evan's inner dragon

480
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:25,386
现在根本收不回去了
and now I can't put it back in its cage.

481
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,291
帕克在哪里啊
Where's Parker?

482
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:32,393
我的猛龙想要把他乱丢一气
My dragon wants to throw him around some more.

483

我什么都不知道  小伙子
No idea what you're talking about, son.

484
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,499
老头  别想忽悠我
Don't lie to me, old man.

485
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,268
我看见他在你后面发抖了
I can see him trembling behind you.

486
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:45,473
我不是说过不能在屋里乱跑吗
What did I say about running in the house?

487
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,375
我不是说过不能乱搭话吗  女士
What did I say about talking back, woman?

488
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,347
站定  简直激动死了
Stop, drop and howl.

489
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,616
爸  《太空狼人》导演组来电话了
Dad, the "space werewolves" movie people called,

很明显  我的视频火了
and apparently my video went viral.

491
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,288
他们唯一比免费宣传更喜欢的
And the only thing they love more than all the free publicity

492
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:01,522
就是你拍的免费照片啊

493

我成功回到主演的候选名单了

495
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,263
啊
Aah!

496
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,233
克制住你的龙  克制住你的龙
Cage your dragon! Cage your dragon!

497
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,569
嗨  埃文
Hi, Evan.

498
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:24,345
噢  对哦
Oh, right.

499
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,980
No wonder everyone looks me so wired at the mall.
怪不得在超市人人看我眼神都这么怪呢
