1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,503
好了 尝一口吧
Okay. Take a sip.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,173
你肯定猜不出饮料里混了什么
You will never guess what's in this one.

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:18,184
脱脂奶  鳄梨汁  花生酱  一丁点青春痘痂
Skim milk, avocado, peanut butter, a hint of zit puss,

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,424
芹菜汁和半个嚼烂的鸡块
celery juice and half a chewed-up chicken nugget.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,196
尽管我说过了  但我还是要赞叹一遍
I have said it before, and I will say it again.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,397
太惊人了
Amazing.

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,432
小伙子们  小伙子们
Boys boys boys boys boys boys.

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,635
准备好欢欣鼓舞吧
Set your phasers to excitement.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,504
好的
Okay.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,539
《太空狼人》的制片人刚刚来电话了
The producers of "space werewolves" just called.

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:44,376
很显然主演的候选名单上还剩下三个人了
There are apparently only three actors still in the running for the lead,

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,544
而我就是其中之一
and I'm one of them!

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,213
哇
Whoo!

16
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,516
《太空狼人》
"Space werewolves"

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,553
是有史以来最伟大的科幻漫画小说了
is the greatest Sci-Fi graphic novel ever.

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,525
这是半人半狼的特里斯坦·莱肯和他的
It is the epic tale of Tristan Lycanth, half-wolf, half-human,

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,328
星球保卫战的史诗故事
and his battle to save his planet.

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,165
就像是《星球大战》和《指环王》的生了个孩子
It is like "star wars" and "lord of t rings" had a baby,

21
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,501
又被了《复仇者联盟》领养长大一样
and then "the avengers" adopted it.

22
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,339
特里斯坦是全宇宙最坏的家伙了
Tristan is the baddest dude in the galaxy.

23
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,408
但是丽芙要出演 编剧就要把角色的性别从男改女
But if Liv gets the part, they're gonna change him to a her.

24
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,510
这样全宇宙最坏的家伙
And then the baddest dude in the galaxy

25
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,179
就成了
will be...

26
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,347
我姐姐
My sister.

27
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,582
伙计们 我最后一次试镜就在这周
Guys, my final audition is in a week.

28
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,318
这个角色也许会让我在电影界一举成名
This is the part that could make me a movie star.

29
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,354
难以置信
Unbelievable.

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,357
我姐姐就要成为特里斯坦·莱肯了
My sister is gonna be Tristan Lycanth.

31
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,659
和你竞争的那俩倒霉蛋是谁啊
Who are the two losers you're up against?

32
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,361
莱恩·戈斯林和范·迪塞尔
Ryan Gosling and Vin Diesel.
（莱恩·戈斯林 《恋恋笔记本》主演；范·迪塞尔 《拯救大兵瑞恩》主演）

33
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,395
噢
Ohh!

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,233
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,335
不同的朋友
b... b... better in stereo

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,371
迎着清晨阳光
I'm up with the sunshine   let's go

38
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,606
穿上舒服衣裳
I lace up my high tops   oh no

39
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,508
扣篮  热热身
slam dunk   ready or not

40
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,410
秀出你的份量
yeah, show me what you got

41
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,313
站在舞台中央
I'm under the spotlight   holler

42
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,448
准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

43
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,317
你有你的节拍
you dance to your own beat

44
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,585
我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,488
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

46
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,256
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

47
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,557
你想停留
when you say stop

48
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,428
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go, go, go

49
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,431
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the other half of me, me

50
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,566
学不来的朋友
the half I'll never be-e

51
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,237
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

52
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,572
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the better half of me, me

53
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,342
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

54
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,277
你我有
but we both know

55
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,645
不或缺的朋友
we're better in stereo.

57
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,649
- 嘿  - 嘿  你不是一直说
- Hey. - Hey. You keep saying

58
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,217
想做点亲密的事么
you want to do couple-y things

59
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:36,420
现在我们都正式喜欢对方了
now that we're officially in like?

60
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,422
呃  其实一直是你在这么说
Well, it's mostly been you that's been saying that,

61
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,191
但是你说话的样子好可爱  继续吧
but you're really cute when you talk, so continue.

62
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,428
那好  我报名参加舞蹈课了
Well, I signed us up for dance lessons.

63
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,596
噢
Ooh.

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,264
这挺浪漫的啊
That could be romantic.

65
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:49,600
哪一种舞  萨尔萨  探戈  华尔兹
What kind? Salsa, tango, waltz?

66
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,235
霹雳舞
Breakdancing!

68
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,505
霹雳舞
Breakdancing?

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,207
对
Yeah.

70
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,509
呃  迪吉  这一点都不亲密
Um, Diggie, that's not couple-y.

71
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,278
噢  小玛  你大错特错了
Oh, mads, you're so wrong.

72
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:04,414
我做人浪的时候你刚好能接上
My wave could connect right to your wave.

73
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,150
咋样
What!

74
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,253
啊  做人浪啊
Ah, chain wave.

75
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,589
我也来掺和掺和
Give me some of that.

77
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:21,498
抱歉了  伙计们  我对霹雳舞很不感冒
Sorry, guys. Breaking's just not really my thing.

78
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,368
真不敢相信我们是同一对父母生的
It's hard to believe we're even related.

79
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:29,306
呃  嘿  我有个主意
Um, well... hey, here's an idea.

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,342
你们俩看起来对霹雳舞这么感兴趣
You guys both seem really excited about this,

81
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,212
为什么不一起上课呢
so why don't you take the lessons together?

82
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:40,617
然后迪吉嘛 你和我还可以找找有什么我们俩都爱干的事
And then Diggie, you and I can figure out something that we both want to do.

83
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:45,355
我们现在就是霹雳舞好兄弟了
We are breaking bros now.

84
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
做人浪吧
Chain wave.

86
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,366
好  好  做的真不错
Yeah yeah, that was nice.

87
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,534
让你们看看我的动作吧
Now let me show you my wave.

88
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,602
再见了
Buh-bye.

89
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:05,242
准备好了吗
Ready?

90
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:19,556
黑面包  桔子酱  花菜浓浆  上等的大腊肠
Rye bread, marmalade, pureed cauliflower, the good bologna

91
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,194
还有一丁点脚趾甲
and just a hint of toenail.

92
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,397
左脚大拇指上的
Left foot, big toe.

94
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:30,534
完全正确
Nailed it.

95
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,571
小伙子们  你们也知道我对《太空狼人》
Okay. So boys, you got me a little bit nervous

96
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,506
的试镜环节有一点紧张
about my "space werewolves" audition,

97
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,509
所以我决定通过这个来体验狼人生活
so I decided to get my wolf on with this:

98
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:43,180
艾米·“獠牙”·沃尔夫特撰写的《狼人之道》
"The Way of the Wolf" by Emmy "Fangs" Wulfert.
（艾米·沃尔夫特是本剧主演两个替身的姓名混合体）

99
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,615
“獠牙”是一个青少年的狼人女孩
"Fangs" is a teenage wolf girl.

100
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,551
当她很小的时候  她在一次露营中走散了
When she was little, she wandered off on a camping trip

101
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:52,189
之后十年就都在丛林中度过  被一群狼养大了
and spent the next 10 years of her life in the wild being raised by wolves.

103
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,193
我还在想玛蒂是不是就这么变成现在这样了
I wonder if that's how Maddie became Maddie.

105
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,363
她喜欢狼  不敢相信
She likes wolves. Big whoop.

106
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:04,267
我听说范·迪塞尔梦寐以求那个角色  甚至做手术种植了狼的獠牙
I heard diesel wants the part so bad, he had wolf fangs surgically implanted.

107
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,136
什么
What?

108
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,308
而过去整整两个月  戈斯林都在吃公路上被撞死的动物为生
And for the past two months, Gosling's been eating nothing but roadkill.

110
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,543
他们肯定会击败我的
They're gonna crush me.

111
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,379
我需要你们的帮助
Okay, I need your help.

112
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,481
我怎么摸透特里斯坦啊  他最喜欢什么
How do I figure out Tristan? What's his thing?

113
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,183
不用想就知道  当然是他的嚎叫啊
No brainer. It's his howl.

114
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:21,485
好的  我来试试
Okay, yeah. I got this.

117
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,330
听起来五成像狼  五成像丽芙
It's like 50% wolf, 50% Liv.

118
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,599
你们觉得怎么样啊
What do you guys think?

119
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,634
- 选迪塞尔吧  - 选戈斯林
- Diesel. - Gosling.

121
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,511
哇
Whoa.

122
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:59,189
刚才的舞蹈太酷了  Q 舞帝
That was awesome, qpop.

123
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:02,159
对  我从来不会停下脚步
Yeah, q-pop don't stop.

124
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,393
噢
Oh.

126
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,141
J 舞者要驾到了哟
Mc j-town in da house.

127
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:23,480
J 舞者真有个性
Mc j-town be his own boy.

128
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:24,481
致敬
Respect!

129
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,386
乔伊  这是 Q 舞帝
Joey, this is q-pop.

130
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,487
他是我们的舞蹈教练
He's our dance instructor.

131
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,190
噢  那好  很高兴见到你  舞帝先生
Oh, well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. pop.

132
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:37,327
我的使命就是跟随新潮  保持新潮  还要不断刷新潮流
My mission is to get fresh, stay fresh, then refresh.

133
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,566
这就是我的座右铭  托付给你们这犄角旮旯了
I just dropped my motto on this grotto.

135
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,269
这真是酷毙了
This is so cool.

136
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,504
我不敢相信玛蒂不在这儿
I can't believe Maddie bailed.

137
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:48,638
我简直无拘无束了
I feel so alive.

138
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,477
她失去的正是霹雳舞好哥们得到的
Her loss is the breaking bros' gain.

139
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,345
再说了  谁知道我住在这么一个犄角旮旯呢
Plus, who knew I lived in a grotto.

140
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,546
对吗
Right?

141
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,216
各就各位  让我来看看你们练得咋样了
All right. Let's see what y'all are working with.

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
来引领潮流吧  呀哈
Time to get fresh, y'all.

143
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,254
当我开始放节奏  我就要看你们跳机器人舞
When I drop the beat, I want to see you robot.

145
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,562
哦  不
Oh... no.

146
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,270
同志们  你们是故意要气哭我吗
Gentlemen, are y'all trying to make q-pop cry?

147
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,309
好了  我们现在退回到几个简单的动作  明白了吗
All right, let's try to back it up to a simpler move, okay?

148
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,146
这个动作叫“找准节奏”
This one is called "finding the beat!"

150
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,625
等一下  慢点来
Okay, wait. Slow down.

151
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,461
你们到底是怎么打响指的啊
How are you making that noise with your fingers?

152
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,634
好了  开始吧
Okay, here we go.

153
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:56,306
这只不过是个冰棒而已嘛
Okay, this is just frozen mustard.

154
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,576
但是是从哪里进口的
But from where?

155
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:07,117
是在法国制作的黄色第戎雪糕
A light yellow dijon originally crafted in France

156
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:11,288
但是加工地在肯塔基州
but now manufactured in Kentucky...

157
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,289
浸泡加工了一次
Dipped once...

158
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,490
不对
no.

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,460
是两次
Twice!

160
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,496
浸泡在热狗味的水里
In hot dog water.

161
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,499
啊
Ah.

162
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,534
太激动人心了
Inspiring.

164
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,505
獠牙来了  獠牙来了
Fangs is here! Fangs is here.

165
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,207
噢  是那本书里的女孩么
Ooh, the girl from the book?

166
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,142
对  你们猜准了
Yeah. You guys were right.

167
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,544
我意识到如果我要获得主演资格的话  就必须放手一搏
I've realized that if I want this part I have to do something really big,

168
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,282
所以我聘请了獠牙来引导我演出真正的狼性
so I hired fangs to help me tap into my inner wolf.

169
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,152
丽芙·鲁尼  你的快递
Delivery for Liv Rooney?

170
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,187
- 在这里签收  - 好的
- Sign here. - Okay.

171
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,156
哦
Oh.

172
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,625
这是什么  是不是獠牙把她的行李都提前运过来了
That's so weird. Maybe fangs had all her bags shipped here?

175
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,335
这是獠牙吗
Is that fangs?

176
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,471
不对  哥们  这是另外一个给狼养大的姑娘吧
No, munch, it's a different girl who was raised by wolves.

177
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,342
獠牙你好啊
Hello, fangs!

178
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,476
我是丽芙啊
Me Liv!

180
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,448
我在她的书里学到这招的
I read this in her book.

181
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,383
她必须要熟悉一下陌生人的气味
She has to get used to the smell of new people.

182
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,454
你的气味我能接受
Your scent is acceptable.

184
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,294
抱歉运来了个笼子
Sorry about the cage.

185
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,531
我的狼性太强了  我怕我在陌生人面前控制不住自己
My wolf instincts are strong, and I don't trust myself around new humans.

186
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,203
再说了  把我当货物运更便宜
Plus, it's cheaper to travel in cargo.

187
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,307
那好  獠牙  这是我的弟弟们
Well, fangs, these are my brothers.

191
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,319
不骗你  我还真习惯了
Not gonna lie, I'm into this.

192
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,158
很高兴你的来电  鲁尼
Glad you called, Rooney.

193
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,160
我不会错过任何一个能保证狼
I never miss a chance to make sure wolves

194
00:09:57,194 --> 00:10:00,163
在传媒上大放光彩的机会
are accurately portrayed in the media.

195
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,500
那好吧  如果别人问到了  我就会很骄傲的说
Well, then, if anyone asks, I will proudly state for the record

196
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:07,170
你没有吃我的奶奶或是把房子炸了什么的
that you did not eat my grandma or blow my house down.

197
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,338
看见了吧  刚才那叫
See, that right there?

198
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,339
无礼攻击
Offensive.

199
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,176
我们开始吧
Let's begin.

200
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,245
特里斯坦·莱肯是狼人  半身是狼
Tristan Lycanth is half-wolf.

201
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,549
狼是庄严而又凶猛的生物
Wolves are majestic, fierce creatures.

202
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,251
你身上有这些特性吗  鲁尼
You got any wolf in you, Rooney?

203
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,287
呃  不  她没有
Um, no. No, she does not.

204
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,489
丽芙  她闻过了我的胳肢窝
Liv she sniffed my pits.

205
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,491
我可不敢忽悠她
I can't lie to her.

206
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,360
嚎叫一声听听
Howl for me.

207
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,529
这是成为一只狼最重要的部分
It's the most important part about being a wolf.

208
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,564
这宣示了你的尊严
It asserts your dominance.

209
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:38,568
我的嚎叫声是有尊严又花哨的
Well, my howl is dom-alicious.

212
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,283
鲁尼  我们的工作量不小啊
Rooney, we have work to do.

213
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,517
什么
What?

214
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:57,654
你要学会向狼一样生活  捕猎  进食
You're gonna live like a wolf, hunt like a wolf, eat like a wolf

215
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,622
甚至要向狼一样大便
and poop like a wolf.

216
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,158
噢  我可以给她演示最后一种
Oh, I can show her the last one.

217
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:10,333
没错  我可以模仿 84 种动物大便的方式
Yeah, I can imitate the pooping styles of 84 different animal species.

218
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:14,170
非常感谢你提供的便便样本  小子
Your offer of a poop demo is appreciated, little man.

219
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,239
但是丽芙现在是我的学生了
But Liv's my student now.

220
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,408
欢迎进入狼的生活
Welcome to my wolf pack.

222
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,446
这简直太酷了
This is gonna be so awesome.

223
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,443
如果你需要上厕所  只要出门直走就可以
And if you need the restroom, it's just back that way.

224
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:31,611
得了吧
Nah.

225
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,447
在我进来之前就在你们走廊上留了领地标记了
Marked my territory on your porch before I came in.

226
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,317
噢  身上好痒
Ooh, got an itch.

227
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,585
挠不到  挠不到
Can't get it. Can't get it.

228
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,586
- 挠不到  - 好吧
- Can't get it. - Okay.

229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,421
帮帮同类啊
Help a wolf out!

230
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:42,655
噢
Oh!

232
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,593
啊  这就舒服多了
Ahh, that's the stuff.

233
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,328
是吗
Yeah?

234
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,663
这狼孩简直疯了
Wolf girl is cray cray.

235
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,433
不过我还需要她训练我身上那种丛林山野的气息
But she is going to give me the forest cred

236
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,801
我才能通过这次试镜
that I need to really nail this audition.

237
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,404
有本事你就把那从马路上拖下来吃了啊  戈斯林
Scrape that off the road and eat it, Gosling.

238
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,642
这些是从把我养大的狼家里带出来的东西
This is from the forest where my wolf family raised me.

239
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:05,578
这些东西的的味道都不太好闻
Lots of good stink to roll around in.

240
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,579
哦
Oh!

241
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,550
啊
Ah.

243
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,657
舒服啊
Ahh.

244
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,527
到你了  小狼崽子
Your turn, wolf pup.

245
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,329
去打打滚吧
Get up in it.

246
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,497
好吧
Okay.

248
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,469
呼
Whoo.

249
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,638
看看我
Look at me.

250
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:35,308
在一堆脏兮兮的东西上蹭来蹭去
Scooting around in the filth.

251
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,576
呼
Whoo.

252
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,644
就像是动物一样
Like an animal.

253
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:39,312
我真是野性十足啊
I am wild!

254
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,316
- 鲁尼  - 怎么了
- Rooney... - Yeah?

255
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,684
- 我就把话直说了吧  - 嗯哼
- Can I get real for a minute? - Mm-hmm?

256
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:48,554
如果你想在试镜中脱颖而出  你就要像真狼一样
If you want to ace this audition, you have to go full wolf.

257
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,490
狼是领地意识很强的动物
Wolves are territorial animals.

258
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,557
- 好的  - 它们拿走了的东西
- Yeah. - They take what's theirs,

259
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,593
- 就永远别想拿回来了  - 好吧
- and they don't back down. - Yeah.

260
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,761
我们来试试别的吧
Let's try something else.

261
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,529
干嘛呢
What?

262
00:12:58,532 --> 00:12:59,565
你想拿回去么
You want it?

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,533
来抢啊
Take it.

264
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,369
好吧
Okay.

269
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:25,291
我这就去拿水枪
I'm gonna go get the hose.

271
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,597
- 这才叫节奏  - 给力啊
- Sick beat. - Super tight.

272
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,668
看来
So...

273
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,537
你们俩从霹雳舞好哥们发展成
The two of you have gone from breakdancing

274
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,472
耳机都一块用了啊
to sharing ear buds.

275
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,374
真可爱啊
That is so cute.

276
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:47,613
Q 舞帝说你要敢于分享啊
Q-pop says you gotta dare to share.

277
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,583
对了  说到分享  我最近一直都没看见你了
Yeah. Speaking of sharing, I haven't really seen you much lately.

278
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,518
你想不想放学之后吃点冰激凌呢
Do you want to go grab some fro-yo after school?

279
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:56,322
哦  求之不得  但是今晚我们要上舞蹈课
Oh, I'd love to, but we have a breaking lesson tonight.

280
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,758
来看看咱们新学的时髦动作
Check out these funky fresh moves.

281
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,261
- 预备 约瑟夫  - 准备好了 小迪
- Ready, Joseph? - So ready, digs.

282
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,597
五  六  七  八
Five, six, seven, eight.

283
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,432
咋样  好啊
What? Yeah!

284
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,267
动一动  哦  哦
Some of this? Oh, oh!

285
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,435
蹲到地板上
And down to the ground.

286
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,271
呃啊
Uh!

287
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,339
拉我起来
Beam me up!
（这句话语出《星际迷航》）

290
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:19,278
- 咋样  - 酷毙了
- What up? - Fist bump.

291
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,614
亮相吧
Good sesh.

293
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,298
今早的训练太棒了  獠牙
Great training sesh this morning, fangs.

294
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,334
赶鸭子实在是太好玩了
It was so much fun chasing ducks.

295
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,302
可不是嘛
Tell me about it.

296
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,471
它们真是身在福中不知福
They've had it too good for too long.

297
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,474
我觉得午餐有肉下肚了
I think we've earned lunch.

299
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,621
怎么在地板上吃东西
Eating off the floor.

300
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,557
你们是给狼养大的么
Were you raised by wolves?

301
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,392
妈
Mom.

302
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,560
噢  抱歉抱歉
Oh, sorry sorry.

303
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,562
真是太对不起了
Sorry sorry sorry.

304
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,269
獠牙  你能这么辛苦地训练我真是谢谢了
Thanks for training with me so hard this week, fangs.

305
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,437
我这次试镜胜券在握了
I am going to nail this audition.

306
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,573
我拿定了这个角色  对不对
That part is so mine, am I right?

308
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,381
当一只狼很安静  就说明它不同意我的看法
When the wolf is silent, the wolf disapproves.

309
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:29,382
到底怎么了
What's wrong?

310
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,387
就你现在的表现而言  唯一能搞定试镜的方式
As good as you're doing, the only way you're gonna nail that audition

311
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,389
就是搞定你的嚎叫声
is if you nail your howl.

312
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,391
这是每一只狼的灵魂所在
It is the heart and soul of any wolf.

314
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,331
呃  我
Wow, I...

315
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:48,501
觉得你好像吓着所有邻居家的狗狗了
Think you scared every dog in the neighborhood.

316
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:49,635
不
No.

317
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,572
隔壁街区有只杜宾狗没回复我
There's a doberman on the next block who didn't reply.

320
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,744
这下他回复了
There he is.

321
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,379
他是在道歉
He apologized.

322
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,316
你总不能一边撒尿一边嚎叫吧
You can't pee and bark at the same time.

323
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,585
好了  鲁尼  到你了
Okay, Rooney. Your turn.

324
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,686
好的
Okay.

327
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,593
(曲调是福音歌曲《奇异恩典》)

328
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,266
别再不务正业了
Quit goofing around.

329
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,435
你嚎叫的时候一点都不认真
You're not taking your howl seriously.

330
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,337
跟你说吧
You know what?

331
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,371
我不干了
I'm out.

332
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,606
什么
What?

333
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,442
你不能不干啊  我们是一伙的
You can't be out. We're in a pack.

334
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,344
你还舔过我的脸呢
You licked my face.

335
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:33,679
抱歉了  鲁尼
I'm sorry, Rooney.

336
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,448
我们已经尽力了
We've gone as far as we can go.

337
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:39,518
还有就是我总痒痒  但你妈不给我在你们家地毯上挠屁股
Plus, I'm itchy and your mom won't let me drag my butt on your carpet.

338
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,289
你猜怎么着 好吧
You know what? Fine.

339
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:46,459
我会在没有你的帮助的情况下  成为一个了不起的特里斯坦的
I am going to be an awesome Tristan without your help.

340
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,294
哦  你想吃这块肉么
Oh, you want this?

341
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,462
唔  很好
Mmm. Yeah?

342
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,630
我知道你早就垂涎三尺了
Yeah, I know you want it.

343
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,498
香喷喷的  对不
Yum yum, right?

344
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:53,633
快去拿吧
Go get it!

346
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,409
真是只笨狼啊
Stupid wolf.

348

好的  行的  不要  帮我订好  我可不要  橘黄色的  这是谁
Yes, yes, no, book it, hate it, orange... Who is this?!

349
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,462
- 丽芙·鲁尼  大明星啊  - 您好
- Liv Rooney, superstar. - Hi.

350
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,830
我真心想见见这位敢同时叫板
Been dying to meet the girl who's got the nerve

351
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,766
莱恩·戈斯林和范·迪赛尔的女孩
to go up against Ryan Gosling and Vin diesel.

352
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,702
我想看看你今天给我们准备了怎样的视觉盛宴
We are dying to see what you have for us today.

354
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:32,705
记住  这个角色最重要的特点
Now remember, the most important thing

355
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,707
在于这一段台词最后的仰天长啸
is that big howl at the end of your speech.

356
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,841
放松
Really let loose.

357
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,576
你会有充分的时间准备好
Take all the time you need to get ready.

358
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,744
我不想催你
I don't want to rush you.

359
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:39,778
开始
And action!

360
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:42,648
成败在此一举了
This was it.

361
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,618
这是我进军大银幕的机会
This was my chance to become a movie star.

362
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:51,790
以吾之质子之鞭  降汝于膝下
By the sting of my proton whip, I will bring you to your knees,

363
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,859
以吾为汝之克星
for I am your doom.

364
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,861
吾乃群狼之首
I am wolf.

365
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:59,465
吾乃特利斯坦·莱肯
I am Tristan Lycanth.

366
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,368
然后和
And?!

367
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:06,438
对哦  结束
Oh, right. And scene.

368
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:08,541
我要的狼嚎呢
No, where was my howl?

369
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:09,842
这没有狼嚎可不行
I need to hear a howl.

370
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,511
从头再来一遍吧
Let's try it again from the top.

371
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,780
好的
Okay.

372
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:19,385
对了  确认一下  这次不要狼嚎  对吧
Um, just to be clear, though, this is gonna be without the howl?

373
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,387
这次我要你嚎叫出来
With the howl.

374
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,588
对哦
Right.

375
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,625
你们两个小棉花糖一踏上跳舞毯
When you two marshmallows first stepped up to the mat,

376
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,461
我就知道霹雳舞就是你们的需要的火
I was like "breakdancing is gonna roast them alive."

378
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,566
我也尽了严师的责任了
But I've been spitting a little knowledge to you two,

379
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,867
而你们也算是朽木可雕
and you all have soaked it up.

380
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,577
舞王玛蒂来了
Mix master Maddie in the house!

381
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,545
哦
Joey: Yeah.

382
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,780
玛蒂  你来干嘛
Maddie, what are you doing here?

383
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,848
迪吉  我意识到
Diggie, I realized that...

384
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,5845
所谓情侣
Being a part of a couple

385
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,652
有时就需要爱屋及乌
means sometimes doing things that the other person likes.

386
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,556
所以  我和 Q 舞帝会过  他教了我一些舞步
So I met up with q-pop earlier, and he taught me a couple moves.

387
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,694
我觉着吧  不成功便成仁
I figure if I can't beat 'em, break 'em.

388
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,730
成仁不成那就来跳舞吧
Oh, and if you can't break 'em, breakdance.

390
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,806
说真的  玛蒂  霹雳舞可是 J 舞者和 D 大哥的菜  喔
Seriously, Maddie, breakdancing is mc j-town and dig-dog's thing... whoa!

392
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,408
来吧  Q 舞帝
Cue it, pop.

393
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,743
喔  就是这样
Oh, that's how I do!

395
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,736
就是这样
And that is how I do.

396
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,740
哇  好吧  乔伊  走起
Yeah, okay. Beat it, Joey.

398
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,848
我是说那个走起
The other "beat it."

399
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,416
知道啦
I know.

401
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:03,422
好
Okay.

402
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:08,494
准备来一个狼人的嚎叫吧  很关键哦
Get ready for a howl that is going to change your life.

403
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,795
好咧  准备好了
(Chuckles) Okay, get ready.

404
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:13,599
来了哦
It's coming. (Clears throat)

405
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,633
你知道的
Although, you know...

406
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:19,605
刚刚想了想
Just sort of like off the top of my head,

407
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:23,442
少点吼叫多点清脆怎么样
what if it was sort of less of a howl and more of a whistle?

408
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,444
嗯  嗯
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:26,779
我是说  观众完全
'Cause I mean, the audience totally...

410
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:27,880
你嚎一嗓子不就是了吗
just howl!

411
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:30,783
明白
Got it.

413
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,693
我叫“獠牙”·沃尔夫特  我是来这儿试镜特里斯坦的
My name is Fangs Wolfert, and I'm here to try out for the part of Tristan.

415
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:45,831
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

417
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,569
给我一分钟时间和我的狼人教练私聊一会儿
Just give me one second to talk to my wolf coach real quick.

418
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:51,570
给我出去
Get out.

419
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,474
狼人  有志者事竟成
A wolf takes what it wants.

420
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:56,809
我现在就要拿下这个角色
And I'm taking this part.

421
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:57,910
噢
Oh.

422
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:01,613
我们可是在舞台上  獠牙
We are on a soundstage right now, fangs.

423
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,416
这是我的地盘
This is my territory.

424
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,851
此言差矣
Doesn't look like it.

427
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,522
我是特里斯坦·莱肯
I am Tristan Lycanth.

428
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:14,460
不  我才是特里斯坦·莱肯
No, I am Tristan Lycanth.

431
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,604
结束
And scene.

432
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,441
哇哦
Wow.

433
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:31,543
我们讨论一下然后回来
Let us discuss and we'll get back to you.

434
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,612
你们去搞清楚是谁帮这个棕发妹子做的头发
Find out who styles the brunette's hair.

435
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:34,613
简直是超爱
I love it.

436
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:37,916
獠牙
Fangs!

437

你还真不赖
You are good.

441
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,563
我知道只要我挑战你的地盘  咱们所有的努力都会有回报的
I knew that if I threatened your territory, all our hard work would pay off

442
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:52,865
而你的狼人本性就会显露无疑
and your inner wolf would emerge.

443
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,567
虽然不知道我有没有胜过戈斯林和迪赛尔
Well, I don't know if I'd beat Gosling or diesel,

444
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:58,637
但是  我做到了獠牙  我吼出来了
but I did it, fangs. I howled.

445
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,805
是的
I heard.

446
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,874

It sounded like my mother.

448
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:17,423
噢  我要紧张死了
Oh, this tension is killing me.

449
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:19,892
咱们的宝贝女儿可能就要进军大银幕了
Our little baby could be a movie star.

450
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,461
不是可能  是一定

I really really really appreciate that,

471
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:09,940
但是试镜真的让我精疲力尽了都
but I'm pretty wiped out from the audition,

472
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,975
所以我还是去睡一觉比较好
so I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
