1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,503
Okay. Take a sip.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,173
You will never guess what's in this one.

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:18,184
Skim milk, avocado, peanut butter, a hint of zit puss,

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,424
celery juice and half a chewed-up chicken nugget.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,196
I have said it before, and I will say it again.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,397
Amazing.

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,432
Boys boys boys boys boys boys.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,533
(Squeals)

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,635
Set your phasers to excitement.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,504
Okay.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,539
The producers of "space werewolves" just called.

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:44,376
There are apparently only three actors still in the running for the lead,

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,544
and I'm one of them!

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,213
Both: Whoo!

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,315
(All shout)

16
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,516
"Space werewolves"

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,553
is the greatest Sci-Fi graphic novel ever.

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,525
It is the epic tale of Tristan Lycanth, half-wolf, half-human,

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,328
and his battle to save his planet.

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,165
It is like "star wars" and "lord of t rings" had a baby,

21
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,501
and then "the avengers" adopted it.

22
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,339
Tristan is the baddest dude in the galaxy.

23
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,408
But if Liv gets the part, they're gonna change him to a her.

24
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,510
And then the baddest dude in the galaxy

25
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,179
will be...

26
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,347
My sister.

27
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,582
Guys, my final audition is in a week.

28
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,318
This is the part that could make me a movie star.

29
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,354
Unbelievable.

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,357
My sister is gonna be Tristan Lycanth.

31
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,659
Who are the two losers you're up against?

32
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,361
Ryan Gosling and Vin Diesel.

33
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,395
Both: Ohh!

34
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,565
(Theme music plays)

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,233
Better in stereo

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,335
b... b... better in stereo

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,371
I'm up with the sunshine   let's go

38
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,606
I lace up my high tops   oh no

39
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,508
slam dunk   ready or not

40
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,410
yeah, show me what you got

41
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,313
I'm under the spotlight   holler

42
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,448
I dare you, come on and follow

43
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,317
you dance to your own beat

44
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,585
I'll sing the melody

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,488
when you say yea-ah-ah

46
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,256
I say no-oh-oh

47
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,557
when you say stop

48
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,428
all I want to do is go, go, go

49
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,431
you, you, the other half of me, me

50
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,566
the half I'll never be-e

51
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,237
the half that drives me crazy

52
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,572
you, you, the better half of me, me

53
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,342
the half I'll always need

54
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,277
but we both know

55
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,645
we're better in stereo.

56
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:29,675
Synced and corrected by Katniss Everdeen www.addic7ed.com

57
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,649
- Hey. - Hey. You keep saying

58
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,217
you want to do couple-y things

59
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:36,420
now that we're officially in like?

60
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,422
Well, it's mostly been you that's been saying that,

61
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,191
but you're really cute when you talk, so continue.

62
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,428
Well, I signed us up for dance lessons.

63
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,596
Ooh.

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,264
That could be romantic.

65
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:49,600
What kind? Saa, tango, waltz?

66
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,235
Breakdanng!

67
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,204
(Laughs)

68
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,505
(Snorts) Breakdancing?

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,207
- Yeah. - (Chuckles)

70
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,509
Um, Diggie, that's not couple-y.

71
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,278
Oh, mads, you're so wrong.

72
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:04,414
My wave could connect right to your wave.

73
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,150
What!

74
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,253
Ah, chain wave.

75
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,589
Give me some of that.

76
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,491
(Whooshing)

77
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:21,498
Sorry, guys. Breaking's just not really my thing.

78
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,368
It's hard to believe we're even related.

79
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:29,306
Um, well... hey, here's an idea.

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,342
You guys both seem really excited about this,

81
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,212
so why don't you take the lessons together?

82
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:40,617
And then Diggie, you and I can figure out something that we both want to do.

83
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:45,355
We are breaking bros now.

84
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
Chain wave.

85
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,393
(Both whooshing)

86
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,366
Yeah yeah, that was nice.

87
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,534
Now let me show you my wave.

88
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,602
Buh-bye.

89
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:05,242
Ready?

90
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:19,556
Rye bread, marmalade, pureed cauliflower, the good bologna

91
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,194
and just a hint of toenail.

92
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,397
Left foot, big toe.

93
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,333
(Laughs)

94
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:30,534
Nailed it.

95
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,571
Okay. So boys, you got me a little bit nervous

96
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,506
about my "space werewolves" audition,

97
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,509
so I decided to get my wolf on with this:

98
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:43,180
"The way of the wolf" by emmy "fangs" wolfert.

99
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,615
"Fangs" is a teenage wolf girl.

100
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,551
When she was little, she wandered off on a camping trip

101
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:52,189
and spent the ne 10 years of her life in the wild being raised by wolves.

102
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:54,191
(Chuckles)

103
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,193
I wonder if that's how Maddie became Maddie.

104
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,427
(Laughs)

105
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,363
She likes wolves. Big whoop.

106
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:04,267
I heard diesel wants thpart so bad, he had wolf fangs surgically implanted.

107
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,136
What?

108
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,308
And for the past two months, Gosling's been eating nothing but roadkill.

109
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:12,376
(Stammers)

110
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,543
They're gonna crush me.

111
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,379
Okay, I need your help.

112
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,481
How do I figure out Tristan? What's his thing?

113
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,183
No brainer. It's his howl.

114
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:21,485
Okay, yeah. I got this.

115
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,153
(Clears throat)

116
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,422
(Howls, scats)

117
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,330
It's like 50% wolf, 50% Liv.

118
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,599
What do you guys think?

119
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,634
- Diesel. - Gosling.

120
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:42,339
(Dance music playing)

121
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,511
Whoa.

122
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:59,189
(Dance music stops) That was awesome, qpop.

123
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:02,159
Yeah, q-pop don't stop.

124
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,393
Oh.

125
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:04,494
(Beats)

126
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,141
Mc j-town in da house.

127
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:23,480
Mc j-town be his own boy.

128
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:24,481
Respect!

129
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,386
Joey, this is q-pop.

130
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,487
He's our dance instructor.

131
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,190
Oh, well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. pop.

132
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:37,327
My mission is to get fresh, stay fresh, then refresh.

133
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,566
I just dropped my motto on this grotto.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,367
(Grunts)

135
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,269
This is so cool.

136
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,504
I can't believe Maddie bailed.

137
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:48,638
I feel so alive.

138
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,477
Her loss is the breaking bros' gain.

139
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,345
Plus, who knew I lived in a grotto.

140
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,546
Right?

141
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,216
All right. Let's see what y'all are working with.

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
Time to get fresh, y'all.

143
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,254
When I drop the beat, I want to see you robot.

144
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,591
(Dance music playing)

145
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,562
Oh... no.

146
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,270
Gentlemen, are y'all trying to make q-pop cry?

147
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,309
All right, let's try to back it up to a simpler move, okay?

148
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,146
This one is called "finding the beat!"

149
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,317
(Snaps fingers)

150
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,625
Okay, wait. Slow down.

151
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,461
How are you making that noise with your fingers?

152
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,634
Okay, here we go.

153
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:56,306
Okay, this is just frozen mustard.

154
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,576
But from where?

155
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:07,117
A light yellow dijon originally crafted in France

156
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:11,288
but now manufactured in Kentucky...

157
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,289
Dipped once...

158
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,490
no.

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,460
Twice!

160
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,496
In hot dog water.

161
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,499
Ah.

162
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,534
Inspiring.

163
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,303
(Doorbell rings)

164
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,505
Fangs is here! Fangs is here.

165
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,207
Ooh, the girl from the book?

166
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,142
Yeah. You guys were right.

167
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,544
I've realized that if I want this part I have to do something really big,

168
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,282
so I hired fangs to help me tap into my inner wolf.

169
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,152
Delivery for Liv Rooney?

170
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,187
- Sign here. - Okay.

171
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,156
Oh.

172
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,625
That's so weird. Maybe fangs had all her bags shipped here?

173
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,527
(Chuckles)

174
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:54,164
(Growls)

175
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,335
Is that fangs?

176
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,471
No, munch, it's a different girl who was raised by wolves.

177
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,342
Hello, fangs!

178
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,476
Me Liv!

179
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,146
(Sniffs)

180
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,448
I read this in her book.

181
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,383
She has to get used to the smell of new people.

182
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,454
Your scent is acceptable.

183
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,292
(Sighs)

184
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,294
Sorry about the cage.

185
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,531
My wolf instincts are strong, and I don't trust myself around new humans.

186
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,203
Plus, it's cheaper to travel in cargo.

187
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,307
Well, fangs, these are my brothers.

188
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:39,342
(Yelps)

189
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,510
(Sniffs)

190
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,482
(Squeals)

191
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,319
Not gonna lie, I'm into this.

192
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,158
Glad you called, Rooney.

193
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,160
I never miss a chance to make sure wolves

194
00:09:57,194 --> 00:10:00,163
are accurately portrayed in the media.

195
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,500
Well, then, if anyone asks, I will proudly state for the record

196
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:07,170
that you did not eat my grandma or blow my house down. (Chuckles)

197
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,338
See, that right there?

198
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,339
Offensive.

199
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,176
Let's begin.

200
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,245
Tristan Lycanth is half-wolf.

201
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,549
Wolves are majestic, fierce creatures.

202
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,251
You got any wolf in you, Rooney?

203
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,287
Um, no. No, she does not.

204
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,489
Live she sniffed my pits.

205
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,491
I can't lie to her.

206
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,360
Howl for me.

207
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,529
It's the most important part about being a wolf.

208
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,564
It asserts your dominance.

209
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:38,568
Well, my howl is dom-alicious.

210
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,372
(Growls)

211
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,375
(Howls, vocalizes)

212
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,283
Rooney, we have work to do.

213
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,517
What?

214
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:57,654
You're gonna live like a wolf, hunt like a wolf, eat like a wolf

215
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,622
and poop like a wolf.

216
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,158
Oh, I can show her the last one.

217
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:10,333
Yeah, I can imitate the pooping styles of 84 different animal species.

218
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:14,170
Your offer of a poop demo is appreciated, little man.

219
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,239
But Liv's my student now.

220
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,408
Welcome to my wolf pack.

221
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,477
(Gasps)

222
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,446
This is gonna be so awesome.

223
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,443
And if you need the restroom, it's just back that way.

224
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:31,611
Nah.

225
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,447
Marked my territory on your porch before I came in.

226
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,317
Ooh, got an itch.

227
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,585
Can't get it. Can't get it.

228
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,586
- Can't get it. - Okay.

229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,421
Help a wolf out!

230
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:42,655
Oh!

231
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,724
(Murmurs) (Chuckles)

232
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,593
Ahh, that's the stuff.

233
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,328
Yeah?

234
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,663
Wolf girl is cray cray.

235
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,433
But she is going to give me the forest cred

236
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,801
that I need to really nail this audition.

237
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,404
(Chuckles) Scrape that off the road and eat it, Gosling.

238
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,642
This is from the forest where my wolf family raised me.

239
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:05,578
Lots of good stink to roll around in.

240
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,579
Oh!

241
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,550
Ah.

242
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,452
(Gasps)

243
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,657
Ahh.

244
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,527
Your turn, wolf pup.

245
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,329
Get up in it.

246
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,497
(Clears throat) Okay.

247
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:25,665
(Chuckles)

248
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,469
Whoo.

249
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,638
Look at me.

250
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:35,308
Scooting around in the filth.

251
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,576
Whoo.

252
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,644
Like an animal.

253
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:39,312
I am wild!

254
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,316
- Rooney... - Yeah?

255
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,684
- Can I get real for a minute? - Mm-hmm?

256
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:48,554
If you want to ace this audition, you have to go full wolf.

257
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,490
Wolves are territorial animals.

258
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,557
- Yeah. - They take what's theirs,

259
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,593
and they don't back down. - Yeah.

260
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,761
Let's try something else.

261
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,529
What?

262
00:12:58,532 --> 00:12:59,565
You want it?

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,533
Take it.

264
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,369
- Okay. - (Growls)

265
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,438
(Gasps)

266
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,273
(Growls)

267
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,274
(Sighs)

268
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:10,610
(Both growling)

269
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:25,291
I'm gonna go get the hose.

270
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:26,659
(Both growl)

271
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,597
- Sick beat. - Super tight.

272
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,668
So...

273
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,537
The two of you have gone from breakdancing

274
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,472
to sharing ear buds.

275
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,374
(Snorts) That is so cute.

276
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:47,613
Q-pop says you gotta dare to share.

277
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,583
Yeah. Speaking of sharing, I haven't really seen you much lately.

278
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,518
Do you want to go grab some fro-yo after school?

279
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:56,322
Oh, I'd love to, but we have a breaking lesson tonight.

280
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,758
Check out these funky fresh moves.

281
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,261
- Ready, Joseph? - So ready, digs.

282
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,597
(Exhales) Five, six, both: Seven, eight.

283
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,432
What? Yeah!

284
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,267
Some of this? Oh, oh!

285
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,435
Both: And down to the ground.

286
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,271
Uh!

287
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,339
Beam me up!

288
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:14,474
(Imitates whirring)

289
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:17,510
(Grunts)

290
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:19,278
- What up? - Fist bump.

291
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,614
Both: Good sesh.

292
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,457
(Both growl, sniff)

293
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,298
Great training sesh this morning, fangs.

294
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,334
It was so much fun chasing ducks.

295
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,302
Tell me about it.

296
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,471
They've had it too good for too long.

297
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,474
I think we've earned lunch.

298
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:55,414
(Both growl)

299
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,621
(Gasps) Eating off the floor.

300
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,557
Were you raised by wolves?

301
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,392
Mom.

302
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,560
Oh, sorry sorry.

303
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,562
Sorry sorry sorry.

304
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,269
Thanks for training with me so hard this week, fangs.

305
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,437
I am going to nail this audition.

306
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,573
That part is so mine, am I right?

307
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:22,475
(Growls)

308
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,381
When the wolf is silent, the wolf disapproves.

309
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:29,382
What's wrong?

310
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,387
As good as you're doing, the only way you're gonna nail that audition

311
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,389
is if you nail your howl.

312
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,391
It is the heart and soul of any wolf.

313
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:42,595
(Howls)

314
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,331
(Dogs barking) Wow, I...

315
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:48,501
Think you scared every dog in the neighborhood.

316
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:49,635
No.

317
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,572
There's a doberman on the next block who didn't reply.

318
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:55,374
(Howls)

319
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:56,609
(Dog barks)

320
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,744
There he is.

321
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,379
He apologized.

322
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,316
You can't pee and bark at the same time.

323
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,585
Okay, Rooney. Your turn.

324
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,686
Okay.

325
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,588
(Growls)

326
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:11,257
(Howls)

327
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,593
(Vocalizes "Amazing Grace")

328
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,266
Quit goofing around.

329
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,435
You're not taking your howl seriously.

330
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,337
You know what?

331
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,371
I'm out.

332
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,606
What?

333
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,442
You can't be out. We're in a pack.

334
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,344
You licked my face.

335
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:33,679
I'm sorry, Rooney.

336
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,448
We've gone as far as we can go.

337
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:39,518
Plus, I'm itchy and your mom won't let me drag my butt on your carpet.

338
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,289
You know what? Fine.

339
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:46,459
I am going to be an awesome Tristan without your help.

340
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,294
Oh, you want this?

341
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,462
Mmm. Yeah?

342
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,630
Yeah, I know you want it.

343
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,498
Yum yum, right?

344
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:53,633
Go get it!

345
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,301
(Panting)

346
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,409
(Sighs) Stupid wolf.

347
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,412
(Whimpers)

348
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,825
Yes, yes, no, book it, hate it, orange... Who is this?!

349
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,462
- Liv Rooney, superstar. - Hi.

350
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,830
Been dying to meet the girl who's got the nerve

351
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,766
to go up against Ryan Gosling and Vin diesel.

352
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,702
We are dying to see what you have for us today.

353
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:31,504
(Bell rings)

354
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:32,705
Now remember, the most important thing

355
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,707
is that big howl at the end of your speech.

356
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,841
Really let loose.

357
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,576
Take all the time you need to get ready.

358
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,744
I don't want to rush you.

359
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:39,778
And action!

360
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:42,648
This was it.

361
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,618
This was my chance to become a movie star.

362
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:51,790
By the sting of my proton whip, I will bring you to your knees,

363
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,859
for I am your doom.

364
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,861
I am wolf.

365
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:59,465
I am Tristan Lycanth.

366
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,368
And?!

367
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:06,438
Oh, right. And scene. (Giggles)

368
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:08,541
No, where was my howl?

369
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:09,842
I need to hear a howl.

370
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,511
Let's try it again from the top.

371
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,780
Okay. (Clears throat)

372
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:19,385
Um, just to be clear, though, this is gonna be without the howl?

373
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,387
With the howl.

374
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,588
Right.

375
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,625
When you two marshmallows first stepped up to the mat,

376
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,461
I was like "breakdancing is gonna roast them alive."

377
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:30,796
(Both scoff)

378
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,566
But I've been spitting a little knowledge to you two,

379
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,867
and you all have soaked it up.

380
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,577
Mix master Maddie in the house!

381
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,545
Joey: Yeah.

382
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,780
Maddie, what are you doing here?

383
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,848
Diggie, I realized that...

384
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,584
Being a part of a couple

385
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,652
means sometimes doing things that the other person likes.

386
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,556
So I met up with q-pop earlier, and he taught me a couple moves.

387
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,694
I figure if I can't beat 'em, break 'em.

388
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,730
Oh, and if you can't break 'em, breakdance.

389
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,731
(Mouthing)

390
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,806
Seriously, Maddie, breakdancing is mc j-town and dig-dog's thing... whoa!

391
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,374
(Clears throat)

392
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,408
Cue it, pop.

393
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,743
Oh, that's how I do!

394
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,478
(Dance music playing)

395
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,736
And that is how I do.

396
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,740
Yeah, okay. Beat it, Joey.

397
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,410
(Beatboxing)

398
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,848
The other "beat it."

399
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,416
I know.

400
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:00,819
(Mouthing)

401
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:03,422
Okay.

402
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:08,494
Get ready for a howl that is going to change your life.

403
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,795
(Chuckles) Okay, get ready.

404
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:13,599
It's coming. (Clears throat)

405
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,633
Although, you know...

406
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:19,605
Just sort of like off the top of my head,

407
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:23,442
what if it was sort of less of a howl and more of a whistle?

408
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,444
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:26,779
'Cause I mean, the audience totally...

410
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:27,880
just howl!

411
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:30,783
Got it.

412
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:35,487
(Howls)

413
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,693
My name is fangs wolfert, and I'm here to try out for the part of Tristan.

414
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:43,729
(Howls)

415
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:45,831
What are you doing?

416
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,800
(Chuckles)

417
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,569
Just give me one second to talk to my wolf coach real quick.

418
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:51,570
Get out.

419
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,474
A wolf takes what it wants.

420
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:56,809
And I'm taking this part.

421
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:57,910
Oh.

422
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:01,613
We are on a soundstage right now, fangs.

423
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,416
This is my territory.

424
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,851
Doesn't look like it.

425
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:06,852
(Growls)

426
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:08,587
(Growls)

427
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,522
I am Tristan Lycanth.

428
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:14,460
No, I am Tristan Lycanth.

429
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:15,861
(Howls powerfully)

430
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:20,632
(Dogs barking)

431
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,604
And scene.

432
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,441
Wow.

433
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:31,543
Let us discuss and we'll get back to you.

434
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,612
Find out who styles the brunette's hair.

435
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:34,613
I love it.

436
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:37,916
Fangs!

437
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,786
All part of my plan.

438
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,621
(Chuckles)

439
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,456
Oh-ho...

440
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,924
You are good.

441
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,563
I knew that if I threatened your territory, all our hard work would pay off

442
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:52,865
and your inner wolf would emerge.

443
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,567
Well, I don't know if I'd beat Gosling or diesel,

444
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:58,637
but I did it, fangs. I howled.

445
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,805
I heard.

446
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,874
It sounded like my mother.

447
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:11,483
(Both howl)

448
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:17,423
Oh, this tension is killing me.

449
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:19,892
Our little baby could be a movie star.

450
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,461
Not could be. Will be.

451
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:23,762
Guys guys guys guys.

452
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:25,764
She just pulled up.

453
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,435
Okay, everybody just act normal.

454
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay...

455
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:35,574
More normal than that.

456
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:41,330
Hey guys.

457
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,585
(Door closes)

458
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,365
Oh no.

459
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:47,368
Oh well, who can beat Gosling and Diesel?

460
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:48,869
Yeah.

461
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,654
Liv Rooney, that's who!

462
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:52,706
I got the part!

463
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:53,757
I'm gonna be Tristan Lycanth.

464
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,009
(All cheer) This is amazing news!

465
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:58,712
Let's celebrate!

466
00:22:58,763 --> 00:22:59,996
We need to party!

467
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:01,848
- Whoop whoop whoop! - Party!

468
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,683
- I want to... - Party.

469
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,052
- I need to... - Guys, guys?

470
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:07,020
I really really really appreciate that,

471
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:09,940
but I'm pretty wiped out from the audition,

472
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,975
so I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

473
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,610
(Yawns)

474
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:19,950
Good night.

475
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,687
Six, seven, eight.

476
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,022
- Party! - Whoop whoop whoop!
