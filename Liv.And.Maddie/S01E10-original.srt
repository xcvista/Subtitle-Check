Hey, honey. Check out my latest innovation in tree decorating.

4
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:31,780
I built a base that turns the tree so you can decorate it easier.

5
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,561
I call it "The Tree-zy Susan".

6
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:39,922
Yep. After just three weeks in the wood shop,

7
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:44,922
Dad has shaved five minutes off our decorating time.

8
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:49,423
I finished my Christmas wish list, Mommy.

9
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:52,606
The trick to getting what you really want for Christmas

10
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:54,862
is to first ask for the impossible.

11
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:59,031
I throw in a "Mommy" or two to grease the wheels.

12
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,933
I only want one thing, Mommy.

13
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:04,768
Peace on earth, good will toward men.

14
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,072
[Sighs] Sorry, I guess that's two things.

15
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:12,808
Well, they're a little tough to wrap and put under the tree.

16
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,656
What else is on your list?

17
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,875
Well, I didn't think I'd need a backup, but I guess I could settle for...

18
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:22,209
The Screaming Dragon remote pilot helicopter

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,410
with a built-in 13-megapixel camera.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,456
Well, they're kind of expensive.

21
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,427
But I think we can get you that helicopter.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,395
That's how you get 'er done, son.

23
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,831
Oh, please. Letting Parker think he's "working us".

24
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,822
Has become a Christmas tradition.

25
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:46,504
Last year he asked us to fill in the hole in the ozone layer.

26
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,674
He got a bike.

27
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,403
Seriously? A helicopter?

28
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:53,661
He's just gonna break it in the first 15 minutes.

29
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:55,425
May as well flush your money down the toilet.

30
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,183
Oh, wait, you can't.

31
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,684
His remote control submarine already clogged it.

32
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,863
Mm, I hadn't thought about that.

33
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,450
Operation toilet dive was a search and rescue mission

34
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,385
for the action figure I flushed the day before.

35
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:14,668
Never leave a man behind.

36
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,734
Yeah, you're not helping your case here.

37
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,918
I hate to say it, but I think Joey's right.

38
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,430
You're just too young for such a sophisticated toy.

39
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,765
All I want for Christmas now is revenge.

40
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,300
And the helicopter.

41
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,235
And the peace on earth stuff, but mostly revenge.

42
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,116
And the helicopter.

43
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,238
Dad, come on. Joey's ruining Christmas.

44
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,699
Do something.

45
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,077

You dance to your own beat. I'll sing the melody.

When you say yea-ah-ah.

57
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:11,709
I say no-oh-oh.

58
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,409
When you say stop.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,473
All I want to do is go, go, go.

You, you, the better half of me, me.

Oh, I am so excited that you're headlining channel four's holiday spectacular.

68
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,894
Partly because it's great for the town,

69
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:47,086
but mostly because I'd already told the committee you'd say yes.

70
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,111
I mean, how can I say no?

71
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,303
This is where it all began eight years ago.

72
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:56,328
My little baby's first time out on stage singing her little heart out.

73
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,131
I still remember how you wowed the crowd with "Frosty the Snowman".

74
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,199
And "White Christmas".

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,201
And "Little Drummer Boy".

76
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,721
By the time you'd finished "O Little Town of Bethlehem,"

77
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:12,271
I felt like I'd walked there myself.

78
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:14,362
I never wanted it to end.

79
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,978

Hi. You are the adorable little girl that I get

83
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,384
to share the stage with this Christmas Eve.

84
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,960
I watched your audition tape, and you have some serious pipes, young lady.

It feels so good to be talented, doesn't it?

86
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,581
I want to be just like you when I grow up.

87

Well, you are certainly on the right track.

It's true. Without it, Liv never would have been cast

93

But I didn't really have anyone to guide me, so I wanted to be that for you.

99
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:14,107
You know, this industry can get kind of tough, and it's good to have a mentor.

I can't believe Liv Rooney's going to be my celebrity mentor.

Oh, stop. Celebrity mentor?

Dude, what's with the suit?

107
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,870
I have a plan to turn Christmas cheer into Christmas ka-ching.

108
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,435
Ka-ching just bought you 15 seconds.

109

112
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,526
But do you know what they don't have?

113
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:58,427
Seven more seconds to impress me?

114
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:00,761
A Santa stand.

115
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:05,932
Adorable kids plus sentimental parents equals cold hard cash.

116
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,845
Whoa. You actually had a good idea.

117
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,526
It's a Christmas miracle.

118
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:15,921
Well I spent too much on Christmas presents this year and I owe Dad some money.

119
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,162
I need your help. So...

120
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,499
You in?

121
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:25,538
Keep your friends close and your jerky brother closer.

122
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,267
If I can't play with the helicopter until I break it,

123
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:31,779
I'm gonna play with Joey until I break him.

124

00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,457
the Chairman of the Stevens Point tree lighting committee.

130
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,048
Now, Pete, I see a tree, not a lot of lights.

131
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,524
Don't leave us in the dark. [Laughs]

132
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,105
Classic Nimbus.

133
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:04,033
But seriously, what have you got planned?

00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,974
Are we on the air now, like, now now?

135
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,835

136
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,815
Hi.

137
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:19,292
Uh, yeah we're live to over 50,000 viewers.

138
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,304
Although I think that number drops every second

139
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:24,296
you stand there like a frozen snowman.

140
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:27,858
Excuse me, Johnny. Hi. I'm Maddie Rooney, co-chair.

141
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,203
And think I could shed some light on that.

142
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:33,304
[Laughs]

143
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,611
Classic Maddie. [Sighs]

144
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,549
So we envision a tree completely lit by candles.

145
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,628
And we call it "Christmas unplugged".

146
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,216
Hmm. "Christmas unplugged".

147
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,468
Well, last year the Griswold family lit their tree with lasers

148
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,256
and then they had a stealth bomber fly over and drop tinsel, but hey...

149
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,659
I guess not everybody has to try.

150
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,286
- So... - Uh, wait.

151
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,262
You didn't let me finish.

152
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:04,477
We were going to do the thing that I just said, but then we changed our

153
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,074
minds and came up with something bigger and better and more awesome-er.

154
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,411
All right. That's what Stevens Point wants to hear.

155
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,314
Come on, give me the deets. What have you got planned?

156
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,955
Merry Christmas.

157
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:22,798
Well, Johnny, I think we're trying to keep

158
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,643
our master plan kind of under wraps right now.

159
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:29,137
But I can promise you that the Rooney tree is going to be

160
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:32,462
the biggest and the best that Stevens Point has ever seen.

161
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:33,775
Bam, what?!

162
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:35,365
Oh-ho!

163
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,855
All right. You heard it from Maddie Rooney.

164
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,136
Boom, zap!

165
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:44,093
So don't forget to come on down tomorrow night and see this amazing tree!

166
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:45,777
In the snow!

167
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,835
That's right. Rebel meteorologist Johnny Nimbus is ignoring the mega doppler radar,

168
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:54,211
and every other station in town to guarantee you!

169
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:55,749
A white Christmas.

171
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,058
- Great job, kid. - Thanks.

[Groans]

173
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,981
What did I just do?

174
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,050
I just promised that we could top the Griswolds' tinsel flyby.

175
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,916
Why did I just promise that?

176
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:13,237
Next time, just let me do the talking.

177
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:18,042
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

178
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:21,484
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

179
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,413
Up on the housetop click click click.

180
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:28,149
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

181
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,316
[Squeals]

182
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:32,677
Jenny, that was so great.

183
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:36,736
That means everything coming from you, Liv.

184
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:39,408
Well between this duet and Liv's solo,

185
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,700
this is going to be the best tree lighting ceremony ever.

186
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:46,745
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Rooney, for your wonderful flute playing.

187
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:52,206
It's like listening to beauty share a hug with Grace.

188
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,192
Well, thank you, Jenny.

189
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,881
You know, I was a bit of a triple threat in high school myself.

190
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:01,942
Flute, baton twirling, and flag spinning.

191
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:05,183
Pep squad in the house.

192
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,160
Once you've mastered the flag twirl...

193
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,926
You never forget.

194
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,421
It's in my bones.

195
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,853
Well, I'm gonna go check on dinner.

196
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:19,100
Now you girls keep practicing. You sound great.

197
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:22,248
Aw. Everyone sounds great when they're singing with Liv.

198
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,409
[Giggles]

199
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,756
Because you sound like a dying walrus.

200
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,977
[Chuckles]

201
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,489
You are just too sweet.

202
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,313
Wait, what?

203
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,738
Listen up, blondie.

204
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm making some changes starting with this stupid outfit.

205
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,992
I'm the star of the show. I should have the cool dress!

206
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,595
Um...

207
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:48,081
I'm pretty sure I'm the star of the show. I am the one lighting the tree,

208
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,113
oh, and also I'm the one who had her own hit TV show.

209
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:56,618
If you try to steal my spotlight, I will chew you up and spit you out.

210
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,019
Mrs. Rooney.

211
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:04,526
Could you drive me home? I promised Mommy I'd read to grandpa tonight.

212
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,795
Well, you are just too good to be true.

213
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,578
Sure, I was just gonna get some things for dinner. Let's go.

214
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,143
Not before I get a hug from Liv.

215
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,522
[Giggles]

216
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:16,223
Watch your back.

217
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,843
[Giggles]

218
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,669
[Music]

219
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,016
Oh.

220
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,672
That girl is such an Angel. She insisted that I give you these cookies.

221
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:32,333
[Gasps] Mom! Don't eat those.

222
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:37,607
Now I know we watch our carbs around the holidays, but what was that?

223
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:39,608
Jenny Keene is a monster.

224
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,431
Yeah.

225
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,829
One minute it's "beauty sharing a hug with Grace".

226
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,030
And the next it's "watch your back".

227
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:51,232
Honey, that can't be true.

228
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,784
During the ride home, she sang me "the 12 days of Christmas"...

229
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,856
Complimented my shoes, and offered me gas money.

230
00:11:56,857 --> 00:12:01,091
Ha! She's a liar. Your shoes are hideous.

231
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,275
Honey...

232
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:08,176
Imagine how scared that little girl must be to share a spotlight with Liv Rooney.

233
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:12,831
Yeah. [Chuckles] I guess you're right.

234
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,972
Must be so cold there in my shadow.

235
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,178
Look, this is what being a mentor is all about.

236
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,895
That little girl needs your guidance.

237
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,861
I guess everybody gets nervous in different ways.

238
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,659
You know some people chew their fingernails,

239
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,854
and other people turn into a Demon spawn.

240
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,625
Well, let's cheer ourselves up.

241
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:36,925
We can watch the clip of your Dad freezing up on the news again.

242
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,766
- Merry Christmas. - [Both laugh]

243
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,477
[Clears throat]

244
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:46,802
Status update, Dad?

245
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,952
I've strung seven and a half miles of tree lights,

246
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:52,744
hardwired her into the main power grid to the school,

247
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:56,816
and duct taped 19 power strips together.

248
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,715
[Grunts]

249
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:00,154
- We are gonna blow the Griswolds away. - [Grunts]

250
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,538
Hey. Check out the awesome tree topper I found.

251
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,343
You... [chuckles]

252
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:08,404
You might need these.

253
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,951
Whoa.

254
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:19,667
Every superhero in the world is gonna report to Stevens Point this Christmas Eve.

255
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,008
Go Rooneys.

256
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,470
[Grunts] Yeah.

257
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,781
Run along now. Merry Christmas.

258
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:33,319
I have to hand it to you, setting up right next to the park was genius.

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,309
Why don't you run over there and round up some more customers, my good Elf?

260
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,610
You got it, Mr. Kringle.

261
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:47,241
Oh, how I wanted to shove fake snow in that stupid jolly face of his.

262
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,492
But first, I was gonna mess with him.

263
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:52,804
And frankly, the tips were great.

264
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:55,205
Whoa-ho-ho!

265
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:59,363
Santa's lap is not a toilet.

266
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,713
That is like the fifth kid to do that.

267
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:04,983
What is going on here?

268
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,567
Free apple cider.

269
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:12,468
Remember, you cannot get on Santa's lap until you drink every last drop.

270
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:16,558
Good...

271
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,831
Evening, Stevens Point!

272
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:19,865
And...

273
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:23,936
Welcome to the channel four tree lighting holiday spectacular.

274
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:26,168
Brought to you by Greenstein's Bagels...

275
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,681
Your schmear for Christmas cheer.

276
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,109
Mmm!

277
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,250
Delicious. Hey, everybody, I'm Johnny Nimbus.

278
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:37,918
The only weatherman guaranteeing you a white Christmas.

279
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,785
That's right. No other channel's predicting snow.

280
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:43,823
- Why you gotta hate, channel eight? - [Laughs]

281
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:44,991
Cue my snow.

282
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,793
- Come on. - [Applause]

283
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:49,374
Here it comes.

284
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:53,145
Any minute now. All right, it's coming, folks.

285
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:56,834
Don't worry about it, but hey, right now, I want you to give it

286
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:59,454
up for hometown sweetheart Liv Rooney!

287
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:02,755
And newcomer Jenny Keene.

288
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:06,309
Up on the housetop reindeer pause.

289
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,752
Out jumps good old Santa Claus.

290
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:12,853
Down through the chimney with lots of toys.

291
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:16,625
All for the little ones, Christmas joys.

292
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,365
How dare that ungrateful little reindeer

293
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,584
come out wearing the same cutie claus outfit as me.

294
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,093
And look cuter than me in it.

295
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:28,556
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

296
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,616
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

297
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:34,874
Up on the housetop, click click click.

298
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,549
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

299
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,982
Oops. I think I just landed myself on the naughty list.

300
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,316
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

301
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:48,622
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

302
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:51,824
Up on the housetop, click click click.

303
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,794
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

304
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:58,015
[Applause]

305
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,185
[Cheering]

306
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:07,613
[Music]

307
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:12,821
I don't know when you and Jenny worked out that comedy routine, but it was hysterical.

308
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,125
[Laughs]

309
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:17,038
No, that wasn't planned. She was trying to destroy me.

310
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,015
[Snorts] Come on, Liv. That sweet little girl was not trying to destroy you.

311
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:26,649
Did you all not just see the candy cane beat down?

312
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,820
She was doing absolutely everything she could to make me look bad.

313
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,956
Give her a break, Liv.

314
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,945
Do you not remember how you were at her age?

315
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:37,726
I was not a monster like that.

316
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:42,818
- I have to go get wardrobe. - Got to work on that tree.

317
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,799
- [Camera shutter clicks] - [Sighs]

318
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,080
Ho ho ho.

319
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,843
So you are the last kid on Santa's lap.

320
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,194
What are you gonna do?

321
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,858
Pee on me, spit in my face,

322
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,683
pour itching powder down my suit, throw my glasses in the bushes?

323
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,464
I have seen it all today, kid.

324
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,991
Just pick one and do it quick.

325
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,032
[Blows]

326
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,133
Blowing your nose in my beard was not an option.

327
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,774
Get off of me.

328
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,802
[Groans]

329
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,191
Parker, there you are.

330
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:25,252
Here's 10 bucks. Add it to the pot. How much did we end up with?

331
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:30,265
Including the 10 bucks, that would be... [mouths]

332
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,486
10 bucks.

333
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:37,310
What? They've been handing you money all afternoon. Where did it go?

334
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:41,059
I'm sorry. I meant 10 bucks and this.

335
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,820
[Helicopter whirs]

336
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,705
One Screaming Dragon helicopter.

337
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:57,709
You used all of our Santa money and bought yourself the helicopter?

338
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,639
I also paid kids to pee on you, spit in your face,

339
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,540
pour itching powder down your suit, and throw your glasses into the bushes.

340
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:07,807
Why?

341
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:11,691
Because Mom was gonna get that helicopter for me until you wrecked my dream.

342
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,419
Welcome to Christmas revenge.

343
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,960
Ho-ho-how you like me now?

344
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:23,531
The only reason I did this Santa stand was so I could pay off your Christmas present.

345
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:25,746
[Grunts]

346
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,956
I talked Mom out of getting you that helicopter...

347
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,917
Because I already got it for you.

348
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:37,014
I'm sorry, munch. I had no idea you cared.

349
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,253
Me either. I guess it's just the Christmas spirit.

350
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,414
Come on.

351
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:49,911
Are you hugging me because you love me, or because you're covered in kid pee?

352
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,392
Mm, why can't it be both?

353
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,669
'Twas the night before Christmas!

354
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,021
And all through the park...

355
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:03,677
There are a bunch of people saying "hey, Johnny, why's that tree still dark?"

356
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,913
- Huh? - [Applause]

357
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:09,175
All right, folks. Well, before our big show-stopping solo,

358
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:12,099
Liv Rooney has the honor of lighting that tree.

359
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,399
So let's get her out here, huh? Come on.

360
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,620
[Cheering]

361
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:21,063
[Chuckles, clears throat]

362
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:25,295
Thank you, Johnny. Lighting this tree is a great honor...

363
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:28,782
But it is one that I would like to pass on to the young and...

364
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,988
Very talented Jenny Keene.

365
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,666
This is her moment.

366
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,887
[Applause]

367
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,096
Maybe all Jenny needed was that one person to truly care about her

368
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,680
so that she could blossom into the greatest version of herself.

369
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,623
Get off my stage, blondie.

370
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:50,784
[Giggles]

371
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,855
Okay. Maybe not.

372
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:58,013
Merry Christmas, Stevens Point.

373
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,535
[Cheering, exclaims]

374
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,696
Ha! Yes!

375
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,885
Ha ha.

376
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,310
Uh, Dad, is that supposed to be smoking like that?

377
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:26,782
Well, it looks like little Jenny Keene just ruined Christmas.

378
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:31,223
Christmas Tree down. Christmas Tree down!

379
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:35,014
Liv Rooney, you set me up!

380
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,485
She ruined my big moment.

381
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,746
I hate this town, and everyone in it!

382
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,943
And that, ladies and gentlemen...

383
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:51,464
Was little Jenny Keene's impression of Ebenezer Scrooge.

384
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,689
Yay, Jenny. [Chuckles]

385
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,749
Oh, what a talented little actress, am I right?

386
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,890
So that's probably it for the show.

387
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,738
Merry Christmas?

388
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,853
Oh. Wow.

389
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,154
She really is a monster.

390
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,268
Yeah, I told you, Mom. She is way worse than I was.

391
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,929
It's Christmas, Sweetie. Sure.

392
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,098
Well, I guess the show's over.

393
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,442
- It's a bummer. - Oh, I know, honey. I was...

394
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:33,139
I was really looking forward to your big solo.

395
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,642
Don't give up yet.

396
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:38,612
I think Dad and I may have actually found a way to save Christmas.

397
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,793
Get ready for "Christmas unplugged".

398
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,248
[Squeals]

399
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,577
And Liv gets to sing "let it snow".

400
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,618
That is the only song you'll be singing, right?

401
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,424
[Guitar playing]

402
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:57,463
Oh, the weather outside is frightful.

403
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:01,200
But the fire is so delightful.

404
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:04,537
And since we've no place to go...

405
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:08,157
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow.

406
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:09,948
[Flute playing]

407
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:13,139
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping.

408
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,080
And I've bought some corn for popping.

409
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,193
The lights are turned way down low.

410
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:24,934
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow...

411
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:28,139
Even though it didn't snow, it's kind of the perfect Christmas Eve, huh?

412
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,573
Yeah, except I already broke my helicopter.

413
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,217
Well, at least you have a backup.

414
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,188
Nope, broke that one too.

415
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,506
All the way home I'll be warm.

416
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,661
The fire is slowly dying.

417
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:46,621
And my dear, we're still goodbye-ing.

418
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,798
But as long as you love me so.

419
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,419
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow.

420
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,195
[Cheering]

421
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,805
All right, listen. Good night, everybody.

422
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:05,963
I know it didn't snow, but at least it didn't rain, right?

423
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,804
- [Thunder crashes] - [All groan]

424
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,729
Are you kidding me?

425
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:24,292
Uh, Parker, Dad, come quick before it stops.

426
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:27,472
- What is it, son? - Is it snowing on Christmas?

427
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,513
Better.

428
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,430
[Laughs]

429
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,401
I got her those for Christmas.

430
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:46,327
Oh, thank you, Father.

431
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:52,228
