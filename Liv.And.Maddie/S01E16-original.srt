2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,849
And turn. And turn.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,902
- And turn. And turn. - And stop.

4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:12,855
Liv, I'm not your personal supermodel.

5
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:14,941
Oh, Maddie, I never said you were.

6
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,909
You are my 3-d mirror.

7
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,511
(Scoffs) Okay.

8
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:21,781
Well, your 3D mirror is about to quit.

9
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,833
I have a big game against the grizzlies this week

10
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,585
and these feet need to be on a basketball court.

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,754
- So... - Ah! Need I remind you

12
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,789
that this little fashion sesh is payback

13
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:34,827
for you tossing my favorite cashmere sweater in the laundry.

14
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,662
(Chuckles) Okay.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,498
Why do girls get so excited about shoes?

16
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:40,883
I mean, they're just things to put on your feet

17
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,603
so that if you step in dog poop you don't get hookworm.

18
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:44,887
(Both gasp)

19
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:48,691
Maddie, the right pair of heels can make a girl feel magical.

20
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:51,944
And her mother when she borrows them.

21
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,682
Stop.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,518
Why are you dragging tree branches through the house?

23
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,871
Going through the house instead of around

24
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:06,576
gets us to the wood chipper 27 steps faster.

25
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:10,529
Plus we can stop in the kitchen for a nice, cold glass of lemonade.

26
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:15,468
Right. It also creates a trail of leaves for someone to clean up later.

27
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:19,589
Both: Oh.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,593
(Clears throat) Okay, well, let's... let's wrap this up.

29
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:26,763
Come on, Maddie, there's not even a little part of you that's enjoying this?

30
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:29,599
Oh, hold on, Liv. Let me check real quick.

31
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,717
Um... no.

32
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,687
Seriously?

33
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,556
Okay, you can't wear sneakers for the rest of your life, Maddie.

34
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:40,893
You know what... you need to tap into your inner sparkle.

35
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:47,900
Feast your four eyes... on these! - (Hyperventilating)

36
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:53,790
(Exhales) I have found the perfect pumps.

37
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:57,510
Oh! It's as if you were walking around in a bowl of high-fashion pudding.

38
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:58,711
Okay, okay, enough.

39
00:01:58,745 --> 00:01:59,879
I will try them on.

40
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,631
(Clears throat)

41
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:05,468
Okay, just be careful, 'cause if you stretch 'em I can't wear 'em.

42
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,919
You guys have ten seconds.

43
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,521
Look quick.

44
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,890
10, 9, 8...

45
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:14,593
(twinkling)

46
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,862
(Sighs)

47
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,447
Whoa, mama.

48
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,816
Hello, inner sparkle.

49
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,451
I love these shoes. (Laughs)

50
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:24,453
I hate these shoes.

51
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:31,544
Well, you can lead a tomboy to designer shoes but you can't make her shimmer.

52
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:33,880
(Theme music plays)

53
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,631
Better in stereo

54
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,717
b... b... better in stereo

55
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,669
-  I'm up with the sunshine -  Let's go

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,921
-  I lace up my high tops -  Oh no

57
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,840
-  slam dunk -  Ready or not

58
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,509
yeah, show me what you got

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,728
-  I'm under the spotlight -  Holler

60
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,730
I dare you, come on and follow

61
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,648
you dance to your own beat

62
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,734
I'll sing the melody

63
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:56,736
when you say yea-ah-ah

64
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,905
I say no-oh-oh

65
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,906
when you say stop

66
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,743
all I want to do is go, go, go

67
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:06,746
you, you, the other half of me, me

68
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,481
the half I'll never be-e

69
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,585
the half that drives me crazy

70
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:15,504
you, you, the better half of me, me

71
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,673
the half I'll always need

72
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,675
but we both know

73
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,627
we're better in stereo.

74
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,599
Here you go, Mrs. Rooney.

75
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,601
I baked fresh muffins.

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,637
My buddy Evan is the perfect houseguest.

77
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,505
He makes his bed. He gets the paper.

78
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,607
He bakes fresh muffins.

79
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,808
He's just so thoughtful,

80
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,477
and does it all with a smile on that sweet, freckly face.

81
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,846
He's really making me look bad.

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Well, thank you, Evan.

83
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:46,869
I am not used to all this attention.

84
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:48,621
Ahem.

85
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,525
Bless you?

86
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,916
I really appreciate you letting me stay here while my mom's at a convention.

87
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,835
Why don't you take a few minutes for yourself and I'll clean up here?

88
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,504
You are like a dream.

89
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:09,842
Parker, you could learn a little something from your friend.

90
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,845
Dude, we gotta talk.

91
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:18,734
Great! My mom says talking is the best way to unburden your soul.

92
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,906
I totally get you're trying to be helpful, but the more you do for my mom,

93
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:26,609
the more she'll expect from me.

94
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,611
I got a good thing going here.

95
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:32,698
And I don't need you waltzing in and ruining it!

96
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,785
My mom says being helpful is a ray of light

97
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,753
I can just shine on our happy home.

98
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:40,673
Not true.

99
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,926
The goal is to get out of chores.

100
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,463
Pfft.

101
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,849
Parker, you're hilarious.

102
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,586
Oh, wait, you're serious?

103
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,890
If your parents think that you're not capable of doing anything,

104
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,776
you'll never have to do another chore again.

105
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:02,445
(Gasps)

106
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,763
Does such a world exist?!

107
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,482
It does.

108
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,766
Let me show you a way.

109
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:10,486
A better way.

110
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,455
The Parker way.

111
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,797
C-plus?

112
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,450
In gym?

113
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:27,837
Dad.

114
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:32,641
Ha! Loving father man who wears the whistle.

115
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:37,763
If I don't keep my perfect G.P.A., I will never be valedictorian.

116
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:42,818
And I have been talking a lot of smack in robotics club.

117
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:45,654
So has the smack-talking robot I built.

118
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,774
Sorry, son, but I had to mark you down

119
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,478
because you didn't finish your shuttle run in under 35 seconds.

120
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:56,582
35 seconds? Daddy, that's impossible.

121
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,816
Oh, yeah?

122
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,752
Hey, Diggie.

123
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,454
We're go for shuttle run.

124
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:05,758
Timer starts now.

125
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,626
If you want, I can give you a retest,

126
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,495
but you're only going to get one shot at it.

127
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,631
Joey: You're telling me the only way I'm going to be valedictorian

128
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:16,435
is if I scurry across the gym floor like a jock-roach.

129
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,887
I don't make the rules, son.

130
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,522
I just blow the whistle.

131
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,673
Also, I teach health class.

132
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,859
So if you have any questions about your changing body,

133
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,844
my door is always open.

134
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:29,698
Yeah, let's keep that door closed.

135
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,450
Done!

136
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,684
Nice shuttle run, Diggie.

137
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:35,654
28.7 seconds.

138
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,573
I don't think any less of you, son.

139
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,710
Hey!

140
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,695
Diggie.

141
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,748
My favorite varsity athlete

142
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:50,553
and the only one who has never purpled my nurples.

143
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:51,703
I need a favor.

144
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:54,473
I need to do the shuttle run in under 35 seconds.

145
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,591
Oh, so you want me to train you?

146
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:59,812
- I'd be happy to. - Actually, I was thinking you'd do it for me.

147
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,647
I'd give you some glasses.

148
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:02,815
Some fancy tube socks.

149
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,403
Joey, no offense, but no one's going to believe that I'm you.

150
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,555
You know what... you're right.

151
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,607
Why did I have to be born so handsome?

152
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,731
Oh, hey.

153
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,568
Heard you weren't feeling very well.

154
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,902
Oh, yeah. Must be a bug or something.

155
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,590
Mm, well, I hope you'll be okay for the game against the grizzlies tomorrow.

156
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,708
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

157
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,710
Mm-hmm. Can I get you some ginger ale?

158
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,879
Or some crackers?

159
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,682
Um, no, I'm... I'm fine.

160
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,851
I'm also over here.

161
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,519
What are you looking for?

162
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:41,887
Oh! (Chuckles)

163
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,639
A fever.

164
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,560
Aww!

165
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,729
Hey, mom. Mom.

166
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,448
Hmm?

167
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,899
You're looking for Liv's perfect pumps, aren't you?

168
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,568
What? No.

169
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:58,454
No, I... I can't stop thinking about them.

170
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,656
I want to slip 'em on.

171
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:03,542
Even just a toe. I just need a taste.

172
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:07,713
Mm, yeah, well, they're actually not in here.

173
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,465
I just saw Liv coming and looking for them.

174
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,418
So if I see them, I will let you know.

175
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,802
But... hey, mom. In the meantime,

176
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,623
you might want to slip on a size 10 dose of dignity.

177
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:18,757
You're right.

178
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,559
I don't know what's gotten into me.

179
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:21,844
If you tell Liv I was here, and you will be...

180
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,846
what's wrong with me?

181
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:32,571
Hi, girls.

182
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:33,822
I just lied to my mom.

183
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:35,774
About shoes.

184
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,444
(Twinkling)

185
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,832
Ha! And I don't even care.

186
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:50,592
And this is my locker.

187
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,879
(Gasps) Hide, girls.

188
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,881
Oh, hi, Maddie.

189
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,549
I'm glad you're feeling better.

190
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,801
What? Oh. Yeah. (Coughs)

191
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,918
Way better.

192
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:05,557
Um... Oh, wow. You know what... I hear two students

193
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,609
trying to work through an emotional issue around the corner.

194
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:08,727
I'm coming. Make way.

195
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,479
Therapist coming through!

196
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,531
Rooney.

197
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,816
What happened to you yesterday?

198
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,534
We were supposed to meet for fro-yo.

199
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,486
You didn't show-yo.

200
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,788
Had to get it to go-yo.

201
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,658
Uh, yeah. Didn't you get my text?

202
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,494
Well, yeah, but... "can't come. Got a thing."

203
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,497
Is not all that informative.

204
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,799
Did you get taller?

205
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,835
No. Yes. Maybe.

206
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,887
(Stammers) Maybe you're taller.

207
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,790
Hey, guys.

208
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:39,842
Maddie, you look different.

209
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:40,926
Maybe you're taller!

210
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,977
Okay...

211
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:47,983
Okay, that was weird, right?

212
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:51,770
I know weird, and that was it.

213
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,857
But she's been acting weird all day.

214
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:56,825
She even skipped her morning workout.

215
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,660
That's so not like her.

216
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,746
Wait, how would you know? She works out at 5:00 A.M.

217
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,866
I was up doing the drills you taught me for my shuttle run retest. Ally?

218
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,818
Nope. I was up reading a book about dragons.

219
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,756
- Hey, Joey. - Willow!

220
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,924
(Screams)

221
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,678
Wow. I've never seen him run before.

222
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,931
That's weird. I only see him run.

223
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:26,555
Okay, when my mom comes in, what are we going to do?

224
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,006
Lower her expectations.

225
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,609
Exactly.

226
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,645
Get ready to experience the Parker way in action.

227
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,566
- Hey, Mrs. Rooney. - Oh.

228
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,684
I know you have a lot to do around here.

229
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:42,704
So I unloaded the dishwasher for you.

230
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:43,956
Well, thank you, Evan.

231
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,041
Oh, but those dishes were dirty.

232
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:47,910
They seemed a little crusty.

233
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,579
But I'm not here to judge how you keep house, ma'am.

234
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,838
Sorry, Mrs. Rooney.

235
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,924
Let me help you.

236
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,728
(Gasps)

237
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,564
Oops.

238
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,766
Come on, Evan.

239
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,768
Be a little more careful.

240
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,823
Oops.

241
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:22,027
Looks like I caught the clumsies from Evan.

242
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,862
Boys, please stop.

243
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,748
I feel terrible, Mrs. Rooney.

244
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:28,784
Let me get the broom and help clean up.

245
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,003
No no no. Do not help.

246
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,671
I will take care of this myself.

247
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,590
(Sighs)

248
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:35,757
What's the way?

249
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,843
The Parker way.

250
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,879
Has anybody seen Maddie?

251
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,747
Our game starts in two minutes.

252
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:43,882
Maddie's not here?

253
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,684
She's never missed a game.

254
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,053
Wait, if Maddie doesn't show, that means I have to play.

255
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,921
That can't happen, man.

256
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,758
During the game is when I get my homework done.

257
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,946
Maddie was acting really weird today.

258
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,899
And did she get taller?

259
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,784
Taller? (Laughs)

260
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,570
Like how much taller? Like 2 1/2 inches taller?

261
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:06,705
Yeah, something like that.

262
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,740
She just seemed different.

263
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:11,543
She giggled. Maddie doesn't giggle.

264
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:12,744
She snorts.

265
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,582
It's like she had some kind of inner sparkle, man.

266
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:18,750
(Gasps)

267
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,885
The shoes.

268
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,671
Um, I think I know where she might be.

269
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,973
So I will just go get her.

270
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,758
Yeah. (Laughs)

271
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,560
See if you can get them to hold curtain.

272
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:32,630
Wow, that girl really doesn't get sports.

273
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,799
All right, stains. You're in.

274
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,685
Fine.

275
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,692
I didn't think I was going to play today.

276
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,030
Maddie.

277
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:51,033
(Thumping dance music playing)

278
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,951
(Gasps)

279
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,791
Hey, Liv. (Laughs)

280
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,761
What are you doing here?

281
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:06,932
Well, I'm here to take you back to the game.

282
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,768
But what is all of this?

283
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,887
Oh, you were so right.

284
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,773
I love these shoes! (Imitates explosion)

285
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,692
Oh! (Laughs)

286
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,010
Well, okay, we can talk about that later.

287
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,530
Just kick those off and we will get you back to the game.

288
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:22,948
Pfft. I'm not going back to that game.

289
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:23,949
(Gasps)

290
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,702
Who are you?

291
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:30,572
I am a shoe-loving sparkly girl.

292
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,690
(Mouths)

293
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,959
Do you want to play supermodel with me?

294
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,860
Yeah.

295
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,797
Of course I do.

296
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,635
(Both murmuring, humming tune)

297
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,804
No no no no.

298
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,640
This... this is wrong.

299
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:52,728
Maddie was out of control.

300
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,880
Whew, this was a much bigger job than I thought it was going to be.

301
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:58,883
And I was definitely going to need backup.

302
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,018
But first...

303
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,737
Okay, one minute.

304
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:02,821
Yes.

305
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:05,890
(Singing indistinctly)

306
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:16,349
Are you sure we can't help you with something, mom?

307
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,536
Oh, no. You boys just sit here and do not lift a finger.

308
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,321
You might break one of them too.

309
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:24,741
I am going to do some yard work.

310
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,576
You're the boss.

311
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,745
Mission accomplished.

312
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,664
The Parker way.

313
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,503
(Both gasp)

314
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:40,340
(Chine starts)

315
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,709
It's beautiful.

316
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:46,730
Um, what are you doing, Mrs. Rooney?

317
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:49,433
Oh, you know, just jamming these big branches

318
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,401
into this hundred-horsepower monster

319
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,438
with 40 razor-sharp stainless steel teeth.

320
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:55,722
(Grinding, loud boom)

321
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,610
Both: Whoa!

322
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:02,362
(Machine shuts off)

323
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,414
No way. Can we help?

324
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,701
Oh, sweetie, if I can't trust you to carry your plate to the sink,

325
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,504
then I sure can't trust you around this bad boy.

326
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,739
Seriously?

327
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:16,376
But there is nothing I've ever wanted to do more.

328
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,464
You know, now that I think about it, I'm pulling you out of karate

329
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,582
and I'm putting the training wheels back on your bike.

330
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,771
But the good news is... bought you some crayons and safety scissors.

331
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:30,390
They're inside. You want uppy?

332
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,561
Nice work, Parker.

333
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,397
We got ourselves out of that one.

334
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,785
(Gasps) Sweet!

335
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,653
It's the 64 pack.

336
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:46,790
It has a sharpener built into the box.

337
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:50,410
Oh, wait. Your mom took that out.

338
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:51,578
(Grinding, loud boom)

339
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,463
Karen: Yeah, baby!

340
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,415
Man, that sounds like fun.

341
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:56,716
More fun than all this?

342
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,718
(Gasps)

343
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:00,637
Burnt sienna.

344
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,472
(Grinding, loud boom) - Whoo-hoo!

345
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,624
I can't believe she's not letting us help.

346
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,560
Exactly.

347
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:10,630
Thanks to you, she'll never let us do stuff like that again.

348
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,733
Can a brother get a fist bump?

349
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:22,359
So if I don't ever do anything, I don't ever get to do anything?

350
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,647
It was my understanding that was the primary message of the Parker way.

351
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:31,701
Well, perhaps the Parker way is misguided.

352
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:34,421
Would fresh-baked muffins make this better?

353
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:36,423
Certainly couldn't hurt.

354
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,460
All right, Joey. You got this.

355
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:44,431
Inside this scrawny, un-athletic, muscle-free sack of bones

356
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:46,466
is a natural-born shuttle runner.

357
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,718
That means a lot coming from you.

358
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,554
But it's useless.

359
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,557
There is no way I can do this in 35 seconds.

360
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:58,395
I can kiss valedictorian a good-bye.

361
00:16:58,446 --> 00:16:59,613
Dude, it's going to be okay.

362
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,448
Just trust your instincts.

363
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,533
And know that the dig-man still has a couple tricks up his sleeve.

364
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,702
Also, you might want to tie your shoe.

365
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,454
Ah, pfft. Yeah. (Chuckles)

366
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:08,738
All right, Joey.

367
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,408
You get one last shot to pass your shuttle run.

368
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,692
Okay.

369
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,579
But before we do this... question.

370
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,414
- Go! - Okay.

371
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:19,666
- (Screams) - No!

372
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:24,537
- (Screams) - Gross!

373
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:25,755
Run, Joey, run!

374
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,374
Joey, you want to go to prom?

375
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,677
No no no no no!

376
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,562
(Beeps)

377
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:36,349
25.4. That's a new school record.

378
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,402
My son's a jock.

379
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:42,606
My son's a jock!

380
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:45,558
Yeah.

381
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,579
Thanks, Diggie. Couldn't have done it without you.

382
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:52,582
Congratulations, little man.

383
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,368
Thanks.

384
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:56,620
I'm too tired to run away.

385
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:00,290
I know.

386
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:05,595
Okay, so we are all here for Maddie's intervention.

387
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,430
- (Crunching loudly) - It is very important that we make her feel

388
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,582
like she's walking into a room that is safe,

389
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,636
and loving, and supportive and... stains!

390
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,355
I am going to slap that bag out of your hands.

391
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,592
Why did you put them out if you don't want anyone to eat them?

392
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:30,770
All: Hey...!

393
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:33,456
(High-pitched) Hey.

394
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,458
Hey.

395
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,411
What are you guys doing here?

396
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:41,581
And why are you all staring at me?

397
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,551
And why did willow just lock the front door?

398
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,503
Yeah, why did she?

399
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:50,307
It's making me nervous.

400
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:55,512
Maddie, we are all here to talk to you about your problem.

401
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:58,481
(Scoffs) What pro... I don't have a problem.

402
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,566
Yeah, you do.

403
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,518
You're obsessed with those shoes.

404
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,353
I am not obsessed.

405
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:04,604
They're just my new best friends

406
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,639
and the only things in the world that matter.

407
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:09,526
You used to tell me how you hated high heels.

408
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:12,329
Have our Sunday afternoon empowerment walk means nothing?!

409
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:14,581
Okay.

410
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,700
So I used to not like them and now I do.

411
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:18,535
I mean, a girl has the right to change her mind

412
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:20,486
and also tell her friends and family

413
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,488
that they are annoying and should stop bothering her.

414
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:27,510
I mean, Liv, you were the one who told me to embrace my inner sparkle.

415
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,763
I did, but I was wrong.

416
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,515
I mean, Maddie, now your priorities are all out of whack.

417
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,666
You missed a game.

418
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,435
Yeah, man. I had to play.

419
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:37,721
I made a basket... for the other team.

420
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,641
And what about our fro-yo date?

421
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:45,395
Mads, it was two-for-one toppings night.

422
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:48,398
And I hate that you're taller than me.

423
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:51,401
There. I said it.

424
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,686
And I passed the shuttle run.

425
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:59,692
Not relevant to what we're talking about, but I'm just so proud of myself.

426
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,698
Okay, guys, it's just a pair of... wait, hold on. You passed?

427
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,334
You know what? I can take these off whenever I want to.

428
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,502
Ha!

429
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,338
Okay, then do it.

430
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:16,676
Well, I said that I can take them off whenever I want to,

431
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,562
and I just don't want to right now.

432
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,764
So... (Clears throat)

433
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:22,381
Deal with it.

434
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,517
Oh, we will. Now!

435
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,770
- (Stammering) - Diggie, grab her legs.

436
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:28,521
Oh!

437
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:29,773
Put me down!

438
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:33,610
Wha... my shoes!

439
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,446
(Grumbles)

440
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:39,749
Liv, give me back my shoes.

441
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,584
Ooh! Muffins.

442
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,403
Don't mind if I do.

443
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:45,455
- Liv, no! - (Machine starts)

444
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:47,573
Don't punish the pumps.

445
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:48,758
Oh, believe me, Maddie.

446
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,628
This is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going to hurt you.

447
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,713
Oh... (Scoffs) Wait, what am I saying?

448
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,581
Like there's any way in the universe

449
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,767
that Liv Rooney would destroy the perfect pair of...

450
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,469
(grinding, loud boom)

451
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,439
No!

452
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:03,640
(Shuts off machine)

453
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,391
It's over now.

454
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,561
- (Gasps) - It's going to start to get better.

455
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,697
But this is so hard.

456
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:14,400
And my feet are... So cold.

457
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:18,771
I have a couple of old friends who want to say hi.

458
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,541
Oh.

459
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:22,792
Thank you.

460
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,577
(Chuckles) Wow.

461
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:26,713
I don't know what came over me.

462
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,415
Well, Maddie, you tapped into your inner sparkle.

463
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:32,385
Yeah, man. It happens to all of us.

464
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:38,641
Luckily, you have a sister to guide you through all things sparkly.

465
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:39,726
So we will start slow.

466
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,761
Okay, this is strawberry lip gloss.

467
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,513
Don't eat it.

468
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:44,630
(Mouths)

469
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:49,551
Here you go, mom.

470
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:55,003
Florida oranges, freshly squeezed, chilled glass.

471
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,905
I'll go start on the croissants.

472
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,741
Thank you, sweetie.

473
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,011
I don't know what's gotten into you, but I like it.

474
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:06,715
Well, I'm on my way home, Mrs. Rooney.

475
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:10,786
Evan... I cannot thank you enough.

476
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,754
Our plan worked perfectly.

477
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,725
You did a brilliant job of helping me reprogram Parker.

478
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,660
Mrs. Rooney had a problem.

479
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:21,964
Parker was using the Parker way to get out of all of his chores.
