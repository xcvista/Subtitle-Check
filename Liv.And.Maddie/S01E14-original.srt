2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:05,458
Thanks for giving my bike a spring tune-up, Parker.

3
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:06,625
No problem, munch.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,427
I wanna make sure the thing that carries you

5
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:11,230
away from here is working at all times.

6
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,400
All right, boys, clear out.

7
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:18,204
Varsity softball tryouts are coming up, and I need the backyard to practice.

8
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:21,207
Forget it, Maddie. We were here first.

9
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,375
Hi, Joey.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,376
Oh, dear.

11
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,447
Backyard is all yours, Maddie.

12
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:31,350
No, I wasn't finished!

13
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:32,685
- (Screams) - (Crashes)

14
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,291
The backyard's all yours, Maddie.

15
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:43,596
(Theme music plays)

16
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,431
Better in stereo

17
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,366
b... b... better in stereo

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,568
-   I'm up with the sunshine  -   Let's go

19
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,637
-   I lace up my high tops  -   Oh no

20
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,572
-   slam dunk  -   Ready or not

21
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,441
yeah, show me what you got

22
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm under the spotlight   Holler

23
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,312
I dare you, come on and follow

24
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:02,581
you dance to your own beat

25
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:04,283
I'll sing the melody

26
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,585
when you say yea-ah-ah

27
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,521
I say no-oh-oh

28
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:10,289
when you say stop

29
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,459
all I want to do is go, go, go

30
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:16,462
you, you, the other half of me, me

31
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:18,664
the half I'll never be-e

32
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:22,268
the half that drives me crazy

33
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:25,337
you, you, the better half of me, me

34
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:27,506
the half I'll always need

35
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,441
but we both know

36
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:31,343
we're better in stereo.

37
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:36,282
(SIGHS)

38
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,349
It's here! It's here.

39
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,584
My future is here.

40
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:40,319
My future is here!

41
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,254
Between two slices of bread.

42
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,357
Your future can wait.

43
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,393
Look.

44
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,263
That's the costume from "space werewolves."

45
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:54,500
"Space werewolves" is a big action blockbuster

46
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:56,635
that's gonna be kind of like the next "twilight,"

47
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,572
except it's werewolves in space instead of vampires on earth.

48
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,173
It's way more believable.

49
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,543
So, you got the lead in the movie.

50
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,313
No. They actually don't think a girl will look tough enough.

51
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,315
So you stole the suit

52
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,583
so they can't make the movie.

53
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,518
You are diabolical.

54
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,355
Actually, I talked them into sending me the werewolf suit

55
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,257
so I can take pictures in it to prove them wrong.

56
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,193
That could work too.

57
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,528
I like you better diabolical.

58
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:24,196
(Chuckles)

59
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,531
Liv, great news.

60
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:26,632
Channel four just called.

61
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,201
They're coming to the house this Friday

62
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,269
to interview you

63
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,504
for their morning news cooking segment.

64
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,407
I'm doing "nibbling with nimbus"?

65
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,376
Yes. Can you believe it?

66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,644
I love that segment.

67
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:43,582
Last week, nimbus deep fried a Turkey with VIN diesel.

68
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,551
Wait, mom, did you say Friday?

69
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,555
So a "space werewolves" movie photo shoot

70
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,390
and a live TV interview.

71
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:52,558
(Chuckles)

72
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:55,261
Okay, this is shaping up to be an oddly stressful week.

73
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:58,297
Well, luckily you have a super-cool mom

74
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,367
who's also a therapist. And she can help you manage your stress.

75
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,269
Good. Because I am going to need your help

76
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,204
picking out a TV-rrific outfit.

77
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,372
You want my fashion advice.

78
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,173
Oh, it's finally happening.

79
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,341
Okay.

80
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,343
How about a peasant blouse

81
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,646
with some sensible trousers?

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,414
Yeah, this was a mistake.

83
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,487
Green belts, the path of the dragon

84
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,188
is not easy.

85
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,593
Hyah!

86
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,528
Do not be scared.

87
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,497
The fly lives, barely.

88
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:32,631
(Fly buzzes)

89
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,266
But only so he can warn his friends

90
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,202
that distractions will not be tolerated.

91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,507
Wow, sensei rae dawn is no joke.

92
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,209
I heard if you look directly in her eyes,

93
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,346
she can steal your soul.

94
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,348
Dragon Parker,

95
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,683
are you ready to advance from green belt

96
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,217
to blue belt

97
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,485
by unleashing your inner dragon

98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,488
and performing the leaping dragon back-kick?

99
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:58,490
(Exhales) Ready, sensei.

100
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,227
Hyah!

101
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:04,163
(Cheers)

102
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,565
Impressive, young dragon.

103
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,301
Your belt.

104
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:12,438
Remind your parents it's 9.95 for the new belt

105
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,273
and 1.20 for the target you broke.

106
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:19,345
Dragon Evan,

107
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,447
- are you ready... - Let me stop you right there.

108
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,284
My mom says I can't unleash my dragon today.

109
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:26,485
Excuse me?

110
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,188
She thinks I shouldn't participate in an activity

111
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,490
where kids are judged in terms of winning or failing.

112
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,660
Especially when I'm going to fail.

113
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,398
Anyway I can get a blue belt

114
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,200
by being open about my feelings

115
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,634
and talking out issues?

116
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:48,240
Seems your inner dragon is more of a salamander.

117
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,441
No belt for you.

118
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:52,344
You have one week to earn your blue belt

119
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,381
or endure the shame of watching the rest of the class

120
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,549
move on to the 2:30 Tuesday slot

121
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,418
without you.

122
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,455
There was no way I was gonna let the sensei

123
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,157
break up the team of

124
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,492
super-awesome martial arts dude

125
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,327
and his beloved sidekick,

126
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:12,331
freckles, the smiling salamander.

127
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:13,432
Yeah.

128
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:14,600
Evan might need a new nickname.

129
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,504
Okay, Willow, ready?

130
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:20,272
Focus. Fire one at me. Right here.

131
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,177
Perfect...

132
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,446
If we were playing "smash that pot."

133
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,284
Willow, you've been in a slump for days.

134
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,585
I just can't concentrate.

135
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,288
Okay, well, softball tryouts are this weekend,

136
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,190
and if we want to be the first sophomores to make varsity,

137
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,291
then you gotta get your head in the game.

138
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,427
What is your problem?

139
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,362
You know what? I just don't feel comfortable

140
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:44,530
talking about it.

141
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,231
Okay, well, we have to get to the bottom

142
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,200
of whatever this is before tryouts.

143
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,334
And if you're not willing to talk to me,

144
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,536
then maybe we need some professional help.

145
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,205
(Gasps) Did someone say "professional help"?

146
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,274
(Pants)

147
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,342
It is finally happening.

148
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,580
Thank you for seeing me in my office.

149
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:05,350
Thank you for the ride.

150
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:08,353
Well, I thought we would be more comfortable here.

151
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,456
And I thought you'd be more receptive to my words

152
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,191
if you could see all my degrees.

153
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,428
So, Willow can't pitch.

154
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,363
Exactly. Fix her.

155
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,502
So you tell me what is the first thing

156
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:26,205
that pops into your head.

157
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,206
Joey.

158
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,542
Joey.

159
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,548
Joey on a horse that looks like Joey.

160
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,651
Okay.

161
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,487
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

162
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,655
and say that this has something

163
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,656
to do with Joey.

164
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,227
Wow, you're good.

165
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,630
(Scoffs) Joey?

166
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:52,664
This whole thing is about Joey?

167
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,399
Maddie, this is a safe place.

168
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:55,567
We do not judge,

169
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,202
even if it is the first place

170
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,370
your brain wants to go.

171
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,441
Okay, so what is going on with you and Joey?

172
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,543
Nothing. That's the problem.

173
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,246
It's springtime.

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,149
Love is in the air, birds are chirping,

175
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,483
but all I can think about is

176
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:15,387
why doesn't my sweet little Joey bird chirp at me?

177
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:18,557
Okay, what... what does Joey have to do with your pitching?

178
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,193
I can't concentrate.

179
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,395
When I pitch, I look directly at you.

180
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,165
- Right. - But every time I look at you,

181
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,533
all I see is Joey.

182
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:31,403
I look like Joey?! No, okay.

183
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,305
(Clears throat) We both wear glasses,

184
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,341
but that is where the similarity ends, right?

185
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,442
Right?!

186
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,379
So the reason you stink at pitching

187
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,413
is because of me?

188
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,183
Yeah. You guys look exactly like each other.

189
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,317
Except he makes it work.

190
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,318
Oh, good, you're here. I really need to talk.

191
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,320
Oh, I'm all ears.

192
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,388
(Chuckles)

193
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,325
Okay, Willow's in a slump and she can't pitch,

194
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,460
and that's gonna keep her from making varsity softball.

195
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,596
(Groans) Sports.

196
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,365
(Groans)

197
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,735
But the reason she can't pitch

198
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,670
is because she can't concentrate on anything

199
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,539
other than her massive crush on Joey.

200
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,275
Ooh, feelings. Yay.

201
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,278
Willow's just so awesome,

202
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,614
and I wish she would realize that there's so much more out there

203
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:28,350
in the world for her other than just Joey.

204
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:32,320
Okay, so make her see that there's more out there.

205
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,457
(Gasps) Put a love note from a secret admirer

206
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:38,326
in her locker, and she'll forget all about Joey.

207
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,695
Liv, that's actually a really good idea.

208
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,565
Actually, I remember in fourth grade

209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,700
when I was so obsessed with marky Stevens

210
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,303
that I literally couldn't even play kickball.

211
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:51,306
And then I got a secret admirer note from...

212
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,707
You.

213
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,312
And who went on to win top prize

214
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,647
in the school kickball-y thing?

215
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,714
Uh-huh, you're welcome.

216
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:08,523
- Whatcha doing? - Ooh!

217
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,461
Do not sneak up on me like that.

218
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,463
What are you doing at Willow's locker?

219
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:18,500
More importantly, what am I doing at Willow's locker?

220
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,435
Is that a note?

221
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,437
Yeah, actually, don't tell anyone,

222
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:23,672
but I'm doing us both a favor.

223
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,273
It's a secret admirer note

224
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,309
to get Willow to stop obsessing about you.

225
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,277
I hope you wrote a good one.

226
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,279
Willow's got a bad case of the Joeys,

227
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,714
and I'm not sure there's a cure.

228
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,620
Hmm, the hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.

229
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,755
Willow's coming. Run.

230
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:54,369
Hey, Joey.

231
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:55,604
(Imitating Joey) Hey, beautiful.

232
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,441
(Normal voice) What's this?

233
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:05,313
Secret admirer?

234
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,715
Oh-ho. No way.

235
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,550
It looks like she's buying it.

236
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,318
(Chuckles)

237
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,487
Stop standing like me.

238
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,489
We do not look alike.

239
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,497
Evan, I know you're disappointed

240
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:23,765
that you didn't get your blue belt.

241
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,500
Actually, I'm cool.

242
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,636
I've accepted it as a part of life's journey.

243
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,738
Come on, Evan. We're a team.

244
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:31,473
That can't be how you really feel.

245
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,608
You're right. My mom told me to say that.

246
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,611
You wouldn't believe the things I've accepted

247
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,514
as part of life's journey.

248
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,416
But I really do want my blue belt.

249
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,752
Then we've got to unleash your inner dragon.

250
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,353
You heard the sensei.

251
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,488
If you don't become a blue belt

252
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,357
by our next class, we move on without you.

253
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:50,559
Hey, just because I stink

254
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,494
doesn't mean I don't understand English.

255
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,365
We are gonna get you angry enough

256
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,635
to release all your pent up inner aggression.

257
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,471
This is the new balance plate lunchbox

258
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,473
your mom made you get, right?

259
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,709
But didn't you want the cool ufc lunchbox

260
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,612
with the dude's eyeball falling out?

261
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,547
My mom thought it was too violent.

262
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,784
Plus, this one had a carrot thermos.

263
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,487
Evan, if you want that cool ufc lunchbox,

264
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,556
you need to smash the balance plate.

265
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:24,593
Come on, dude. Reach down deep and breathe some fire.

266
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,662
(Exhales)

267
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,633
You know, I better not.

268
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:34,469
Mom says if I don't bring it home,

269
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:35,604
I don't get my dessert.

270
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,372
And you know how I love raw almonds.

271
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,510
Liv, you ready for your "space werewolves" photo shoot?

272
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:49,384
Stand back, humanoid, or feel my fury.

273
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,653
(Hisses)

274
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,522
Whoa. You look awesome.

275
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,358
(Squeals) Thanks, dad.

276
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:58,360
(Giggles) Now let's do this.

277
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:02,397
- Snarl. - (Snarls)

278
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,465
-  Growl. - (Growls)

279
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,467
- Howl. - (Howls)

280
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,669
Show me fierce.

281
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:09,437
Boom, pow, Wha-cha!

282
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:14,442
No!

283
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,444
Dad, the armor glue they sent me

284
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,679
said it's supposed to be permanent.

285
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,315
Don't worry. I got some fantastic shots

286
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,449
before your suit fell apart.

287
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,652
Oh, great. That one's perfect.

288
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:25,654
Now I can take these itchy ears off.

289
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:29,658
(Chuckles) Ow.

290
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,660
(Chuckles) They're stuck.

291
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,495
Oh, okay. So are my fangs.

292
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,566
That's so weird.

293
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:39,734
The makeup glue that they sent me

294
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,703
says it's only supposed to last 20 minutes.

295
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:46,708
And the armor glue says "permanent."

296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,354
Hey, mads.

297
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,356
What a beautiful day.

298
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,291
I see heart shapes in the clouds,

299
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,594
and the air smells like Jasmine and hot dogs.

300
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,433
I got a note from a secret admirer.

301
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,401
- You did? - (Both squeal)

302
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:14,402
(Clears throat)

303
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,639
Wow, that's totally unlike us.

304
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,708
Yeah, let's please never do that again.

305
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,579
But I can't really say I'm surprised.

306
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:26,314
You are a top-notch lady

307
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,483
who any guy would be lucky to have.

308
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,752
Now let's get us on that varsity squad.

309
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,788
Turn my hand into a bloody pulp.

310
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,759
My secret admirer is Joey Rooney.

311
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,428
My little Joey bird finally chirped back!

312
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,765
Wait, Joey?

313
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,600
There was nothing in that note about Joey...

314
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,704
I'm assuming because you said it was a secret.

315
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,608
For the first time in weeks,

316
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,411
my mind is clear and I can concentrate.

317
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,346
I mean, it's obviously Joey, right?

318
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,447
(Chuckles nervously)

319
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,282
Okay, so I know I should have come clean

320
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,550
right then and there to protect my brother

321
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:07,422
and my best friend, but in my defense...

322
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,423
Yeah, okay. I got nothing.

323
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,293
Sure. Yeah.

324
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,728
Why not? (Nervous chuckle)

325
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:17,365
The point is that you are out of your slump

326
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,335
and now we can get you ready for tryouts.

327
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,669
Yeah, about that.

328
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:23,404
I'm quitting softball.

329
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,306
What?!

330
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,574
Willow, you can't.

331
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,643
Relationships take work.

332
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:29,778
This thing I have going on with Joey

333
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:31,446
has to be my top priority.

334
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,516
See you later, mads,

335
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,351
if I ever come back down to earth.

336
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,321
Wow.

337
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,490
There really is no cure for a bad case of the Joeys.

338
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:53,368
Young dragons, before we give the weak link

339
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:56,638
known as Evan his final chance

340
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:58,373
to earn his blue belt,

341
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:02,243
take a few moments to feed your inner dragons.

342
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,647
It's snack time. Work with me here.

343
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:09,417
I was about to give up and look for a new sidekick

344
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,486
when I remembered the time Evan lost it

345
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,555
because his mom gave him seaweed chips.

346
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,557
So I swapped out his raw almonds

347
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,559
for some of that disgusting water weed.

348
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:24,232
At least we get to have snack together one last time.

349
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,567
Are you ready for your snack?

350
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:26,701
You should have your snack.

351
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:32,607
- I'm not really that... - I said eat your snack.

352
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,346
I can't believe this!

353
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
What's wrong?

354
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:40,615
It's seaweed chips!

355
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,318
Unsalted, organic, seaweed chips.

356
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,619
I keep telling my mom I hate them.

357
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,588
Give me carrot sticks or celery

358
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:50,358
or even rutabaga, just not seaweed chips!

359
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,527
Come on, dude.

360
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,330
Listen to your mom and eat it!

361
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,432
I won't eat seaweed!

362
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,534
(Shouts)

363
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:01,202
(Yells)

364
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,503
(Grunts)

365
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,607
What, what?!

366
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,375
(Shouts, grunts continue)

367
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,311
(Screams)

368
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,479
(Gasping)

369
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,215
I'm a good friend.

370
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:17,652
Who else wants some?

371
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,623
Dragon Evan, that was your inner dragon.

372
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,391
It's been released!

373
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:26,227
You are ready for your blue belt now.

374
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,463
Yes! Evan, you did it.

375
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,465
Tell me something that I don't know.

376
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,635
Try to keep up, munch.

377
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,409
Good morning, Stevens point.

378
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:43,678
And welcome to "nibblin' with nimbus"

379
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,248
where every week, Wisconsin's favorite meteorologist...

380
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:49,250
this guy... cooks up some breakfast

381
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,487
for one of Stevens point's most intriguing residents or visitors.

382
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:54,656
And this week, we got a tasty combination

383
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,424
of breakfast brats

384
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,259
and the always flavorful star

385
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,528
of "sing it loud," Liv Rooney.

386
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,198
I tried all night

387
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,200
to get my ears and my fangs off.

388
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,303
They wouldn't budge. I tried cancelling

389
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,538
and Johnny nimbus showed up anyway.

390
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,207
So I did what any great actress would do.

391
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,209
I hid my flaws with wardrobe and props.

392
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,379
Live and in person, here she is now.

393
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,221
Wow, Liv Rooney, that is a nice getup.

394
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,257
Tell me, is that what all the kids are wearing these days?

395
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,560
'Cause if not, they will be after watching this.

396
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,695
Ah, who am I kidding?

397
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,530
No kids are watching this program.

398
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,668
Johnny, you are adorable.

399
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:43,571
So tell us, what are you cooking up this morning?

400
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,240
Well, I got a griddle full of brats

401
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,643
and a side order of get to know you.

402
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,244
Huh? (Chuckles)

403
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,547
Okay, now these eggs are ready for poaching.

404
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,249
And here's a secret I learned from Nana nimbus.

405
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,252
Don't use water. Use chicken broth instead.

406
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,287
Liv Rooney, could you open that for me.

407
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:00,388
- Mm-hmm. - All right.

408
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:05,360
(Chuckles)

409
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:06,527
(Bites, can crunches)

410
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,630
Here you go, Johnny.

411
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:11,532
Wow! That was quick.

412
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,268
All right. Now get poaching.

413
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,370
There you go.

414
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,205
Just liberally putting it in there.

415
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,406
They're gonna taste great.

416
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,274
Okay. Now.

417
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,576
Let's sit down to chew the fat.

418
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,244
And I mean that literally.

419
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,645
These brats are 90% fat.

420
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:30,585
Well, come on, Liv.

421
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,220
Come on over and sink your teeth

422
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:33,388
into one of these babies.

423
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,358
Oopsie-Daisy.

424
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:39,227
Oh, Liv, here. Let me help you up.

425
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:40,428
Here... oh!

426
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,264
Either I've had too much coffee,

427
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,499
or werewolves are real!

428
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:50,405
Um... (Chuckles)

429
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,473
Uh, no. Actually, Johnny,

430
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:57,412
I am just giving you a channel four exclusive.

431
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:01,516
I am up for the lead in "space werewolves,"

432
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,185
so to get my fans excited,

433
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,355
I decided that I would give you a little sneak peek.

434
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:08,423
- (Growls) - Oh!

435
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:11,526
Seriously.

436
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,593
You're kind of freaking me out.

437
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,301
Hey, did Willow get the note?

438
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,603
- Yeah, she did, but... - Was she happy?

439
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:26,207
Well, yeah, she was... shh shh shh shh.

440
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,409
All I needed to know is that she's off my scent.

441
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:30,244
You have served your purpose.

442
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,479
Hey, Willow.

443
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:35,249
Willow Willow Willow.

444
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:37,485
I heard you got a little note in your locker.

445
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,320
I did.

446
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:42,323
I bet you're pretty excited about that, huh?

447
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,592
I say chase this rainbow and see where it takes you.

448
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,229
- Um, Joey... - Maddie.

449
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,297
Not now.

450
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,531
I've been waiting for this moment

451
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,566
for a long time.

452
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:56,237
I just can't take it anymore.

453
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,606
Joey Rooney's my secret admirer!

454
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,646
What is happening?

455
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:08,583
Yeah.

456
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,651
Uh, I think it's best that the three of us

457
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:13,321
talk about this in a safe place.

458
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:16,591
Willow.

459
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,295
You can put him down now.

460
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,598
Oh, I didn't realize.

461
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,699
It just feels so right.

462
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:28,536
(SIGHS) Thank you.

463
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,438
Punish Maddie, mom.

464
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:33,374
Make her clean the bathrooms for the next five years.

465
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,675
Yeah, punish her.

466
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,511
Your bathrooms could use a little help.

467
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,281
There are six of us living in one house.

468
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:41,716
I do the best I can.

469
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,651
Maddie, what I'm hearing

470
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:46,521
is that your brother and your overly critical best friend

471
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,489
are understandably upset.

472
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,591
Willow, I was really just trying to help.

473
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,759
I didn't want to see my best friend

474
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,729
drive herself crazy over some stupid guy.

475
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:59,700
Um... The stupid guy is right here.

476
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:03,404
Thanks, Maddie, but you shouldn't have interfered.

477
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:04,572
I know.

478
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,674
And I'm sorry.

479
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,576
But you're a great girl

480
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,380
who  so  does not need a guy to make her feel better about herself.

481
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:14,315
Never forget that.

482
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,452
You're not really quitting softball, are you?

483
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,288
No, you're right.

484
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,390
- We're making varsity. - (Grunts)

485
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,726
I shouldn't get hung up on what some stupid guy thinks.

486
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:28,296
Again, right here.

487
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,301
So Maddie, is there anything you would like to say to your brother?

488
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,270
Yeah. Joey...

489
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,672
Did you eat the last muffin this morning?

490
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:39,373
Maddie.

491
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:41,375
(SIGHS)

492
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,612
Uh... I should not have let

493
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,547
Willow think that you were her secret admirer.

494
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,282
Exactly.

495
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:49,417
How Willow and I feel about each other

496
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,518
is none of your business.

497
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:53,754
- (Gasps) - Oh, no.

498
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,358
Joey just said he and I had feelings...

499
00:21:57,392 --> 00:21:58,593
About each other.

500
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:00,695
(Giggles)

501
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,296
Um, no.

502
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:05,566
What I meant was... I'm going now.

503
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,438
And Maddie, I did eat that muffin.

504
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,478
(Panting)

505
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:18,479
Hide me!

506
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,484
I unleashed Evan's inner dragon

507
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:25,386
and now I can't put it back in its cage.

508
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:28,656
(Shouts)

509
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,291
Where's Parker?

510
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:32,393
My dragon wants to throw him around some more.

511
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:35,596
No idea what you're talking about, son.

512
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,499
Don't lie to me, old man.

513
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,268
I can see him trembling behind you.

514
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:45,473
What did I say about running in the house?

515
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,375
What did I say about talking back, woman?

516
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,479
(Squeals)

517
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,347
Stop, drop and howl.

518
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,616
Dad, the "space werewolves" movie people called,

519
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,618
and apparently my video went viral.

520
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,288
And the only thing they love more than all the free publicity

521
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:01,522
were all the free pics you took.

522
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:04,358
I'm back on the short list for the lead.

523
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:08,229
I'm so proud of my little werewolf.

524
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,263
Aah!

525
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,233
Cage your dragon! Cage your dragon!

526
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,568
(Growls)

527
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,569
Hi, Evan.

528
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:18,272
(Screams)

529
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:24,345
Oh, right. (Chuckles)
