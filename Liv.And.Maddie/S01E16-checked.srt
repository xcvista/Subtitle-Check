1
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,849
 接着转  接着转
And turn. And turn.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,902
- 接着转  接着转  - 停
- And turn. And turn. - And stop.

3
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:12,855
丽芙  我又不是你的御用超模
Liv, I'm not your personal supermodel.

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:14,941
哦  玛蒂  我从来没说过你是啊
Oh, Maddie, I never said you were.

5
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,909
你可是我的三维镜子
You are my 3-d mirror.

6
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,511
那好
Okay.

7
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:21,781
你的三维镜子就要辞职不干了
Well, your 3D mirror is about to quit.

8
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,833
我这周要和灰熊队打一场比赛
I have a big game against the grizzlies this week

9
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,585
这双脚将是要上篮球场的
and these feet need to be on a basketball court.

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,754
- 所以  - 啊  我可要提醒你
- So... - Ah! Need I remind you

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,789
这次时尚的小短会算是次报复
that this little fashion sesh is payback

12
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:34,827
报复你把我最喜欢的羊绒衫混在别的衣服里面  洗的缩水缩成这样
for you tossing my favorite cashmere sweater in the laundry.

13
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,662
好吧
Okay.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,498
为什么女孩子都这么痴迷于鞋子啊
Why do girls get so excited about shoes?

15
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:40,883
我的意思是  它们不过就是用来垫脚的嘛
I mean, they're just things to put on your feet

16
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,603
这样你踩到一坨大粪就不会得钩虫病了
so that if you step in dog poop you don't get hookworm.

17
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:48,691
玛蒂  一双合适的高跟鞋能让一个女孩感到魔力四射
Maddie, the right pair of heels can make a girl feel magical.

18
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:51,944
而她的妈妈也可以借走享受享受魔力
And her mother when she borrows them.

19
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,682
站住
Stop.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,518
你们为什么要拖着一堆树枝穿堂入室啊
Why are you dragging tree branches through the house?

21
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,871
如果穿过房子而不是绕过房子的话
Going through the house instead of around

22
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:06,576
能让我们提前 27 步抵达削木机
gets us to the wood chipper 27 steps faster.

23
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:10,529
顺便还能让我们在厨房喝一杯又冰又甜的柠檬水
Plus we can stop in the kitchen for a nice, cold glass of lemonade.

24
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:15,468
对哦  不过这还会在房子里留下一堆等着某人收拾的烂叶子
Right. It also creates a trail of leaves for someone to clean up later.

25
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:19,589
噢
Oh.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,593
好了  把东西收拾好吧
Okay, well, let's... let's wrap this up.

27
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:26,763
别这样  玛蒂  难道这里就没有一点点合你口味的东西么
Come on, Maddie, there's not even a little part of you that's enjoying this?

28
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:29,599
等一下  丽芙  让我想一想
Oh, hold on, Liv. Let me check real quick.

29
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,717
呃  一点都没有
Um... no.

30
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,687
真的吗
Seriously?

31
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,556
得了吧  玛蒂  你不能整辈子都只穿运动鞋啊
Okay, you can't wear sneakers for the rest of your life, Maddie.

32
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:40,893
你猜怎么着  你要激发你内心的光芒
You know what... you need to tap into your inner sparkle.

33
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:47,900
让你的小四眼好好欣赏欣赏  这双鞋
Feast your four eyes... on these!

34
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:53,790
我已经找到了最好的高跟鞋
I have found the perfect pumps.

35
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:57,510
哦  闻起来就像走在时尚最前沿的一碗布丁上一样
Oh! It's as if you were walking around in a bowl of high-fashion pudding.

36
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:58,711
好的  好的  你够了
Okay, okay, enough.

37
00:01:58,745 --> 00:01:59,879
我会试穿它的
I will try them on.

38
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:05,468
好吧  但是要小心  你一旦把它撑大了我就穿不了了
Okay, just be careful, 'cause if you stretch 'em I can't wear 'em.

39
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,919
你们有十秒的时间
You guys have ten seconds.

40
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,521
抓紧看吧
Look quick.

41
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,890
10  9  8
10, 9, 8...

42
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,447
哇  我的亲娘啊
Whoa, mama.

43
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,816
原来这就是由内而外的光芒啊
Hello, inner sparkle.

44
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,451
我爱死这双鞋了
I love these shoes.

45
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:24,453
我真讨厌这双鞋
I hate these shoes.

46
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:31,544
好吧  你能骗一个假小子穿上女装  但你永远没法让她美丽动人的
Well, you can lead a tomboy to designer shoes but you can't make her shimmer.

47
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,631
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

48
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,717
不同的朋友
b... b... better in stereo

49
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,669
迎着清晨阳光
-  I'm up with the sunshine -  Let's go

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,921
穿上舒服衣裳
-  I lace up my high tops -  Oh no

51
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,840
扣篮  热热身
-  slam dunk -  Ready or not

52
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,509
秀出你的份量
yeah, show me what you got

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,728
站在舞台中央
-  I'm under the spotlight -  Holler

54
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,730
准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

55
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,648
你有你的节拍
you dance to your own beat

56
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,734
我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

57
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:56,736
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

58
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,905
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

59
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,906
你想停留
when you say stop

60
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,743
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go, go, go

61
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:06,746
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the other half of me, me

62
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,481
学不来的朋友
the half I'll never be-e

63
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,585
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

64
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:15,504
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the better half of me, me

65
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,673
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

66
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,675
你我有
but we both know

67
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,627
不或缺的朋友
we're better in stereo.

68
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,599
来尝尝  鲁尼女士
Here you go, Mrs. Rooney.

69
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,601
我烤制了新鲜的松饼
I baked fresh muffins.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,637
我的哥们埃文真是个好客人
My buddy Evan is the perfect houseguest.

71
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,505
他自己整理床铺  他帮着拿报纸
He makes his bed. He gets the paper.

72
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,607
他还会烤松饼
He bakes fresh muffins.

73
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,808
简直是太周到了
He's just so thoughtful,

74
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,477
而且干活的时候满是雀斑的小脸上堆满了笑容
and does it all with a smile on that sweet, freckly face.

75
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,846
他让我看起来糟透了
He's really making me look bad.

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
好的  谢谢你  埃文
Well, thank you, Evan.

77
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:46,869
我还没习惯这么贴心的照顾
I am not used to all this attention.

78
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:48,621
咳咳
Ahem.

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,525
长命百岁
Bless you?

80
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,916
我太谢谢你们能在我妈出去开会的时候让我住在这儿了
I really appreciate you letting me stay here while my mom's at a convention.

81
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,835
为什么不休息一下  等我把这里收拾干净呢
Why don't you take a few minutes for yourself and I'll clean up here?

82
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,504
你简直是个小天使啊
You are like a dream.

83
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:09,842
帕克  你也该从你朋友那里学到些什么了吧
Parker, you could learn a little something from your friend.

84
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,845
伙计  我们要谈谈
Dude, we gotta talk.

85
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:18,734
太棒了  我妈说谈话是给精神减负的最好方法
Great! My mom says talking is the best way to unburden your soul.

86
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,906
我理解你想多帮帮忙的心情  但是你给我妈做的事越多
I totally get you're trying to be helpful, but the more you do for my mom,

87
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:26,609
她对我的期望值就越大
the more she'll expect from me.

88
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,611
我现在生活过得这么舒坦
I got a good thing going here.

89
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:32,698
我绝不需要你插一脚来毁掉了它
And I don't need you waltzing in and ruining it!

90
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,785
我妈说帮人做事就像是释放光芒
My mom says being helpful is a ray of light

91
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,753
我可以以此照亮温馨的小家
I can just shine on our happy home.

92
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:40,673
那是假话
Not true.

93
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,926
她这么说是想在家务活上偷懒呢
The goal is to get out of chores.

94
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,463
噗
Pfft.

95
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,849
帕克  你真逗啊
Parker, you're hilarious.

96
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,586
哦  等等  你是认真的么
Oh, wait, you're serious?

97
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,890
如果你的父母认为你干什么事都干不成
If your parents think that you're not capable of doing anything,

98
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,776
你就不需要做任何家务活了
you'll never have to do another chore again.

99
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,763
那个世界难道存在么
Does such a world exist?!

100
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,482
确实存在
It does.

101
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,766
让我来教你一套方法
Let me show you a way.

102
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:10,486
更好的方法
A better way.

103
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,455
帕克的方法
The Parker way.

104
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,797
C+
C-plus?

105
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,450
还是体育
In gym?

106
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:27,837
爸
Dad.

107
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:32,641
哈  亲爱的戴个哨子的父亲大人
Ha! Loving father man who wears the whistle.

108
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:37,763
如果你不能让我的平均分变得好看些  我就永远都致不了毕业辞了
If I don't keep my perfect G.P.A., I will never be valedictorian.

109
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:42,818
而且我在机器人社里牛皮吹得老大
And I have been talking a lot of smack in robotics club.

110
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:45,654
所以还造了个会吹牛大吹特吹的机器人
So has the smack-talking robot I built.

111
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,774
抱歉了  儿子  但是我必须要给你打低分
Sorry, son, but I had to mark you down

112
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,478
因为你没能在 35 秒内完成折返跑
because you didn't finish your shuttle run in under 35 seconds.

113
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:56,582
35 秒  爸爸  那是不可能的
35 seconds? Daddy, that's impossible.

114
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,816
噢  是吗
Oh, yeah?

115
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,752
嘿  迪吉
Hey, Diggie.

116
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,454
你跑一趟折返跑看看
We're go for shuttle run.

117
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:05,758
现在开始计时
Timer starts now.

118
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,626
如果你想要的话  可以让你重考
If you want, I can give you a retest,

119
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,495
但你只能有一次机会
but you're only going to get one shot at it.

120
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,631
你的意思是我唯一能保证毕业的方法
You're telling me the only way I'm going to be valedictorian

121
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:16,435
就是像只蟑螂一样发疯的在体育馆里来回跑
is if I scurry across the gym floor like a jock-roach.

122
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,887
我又不是定规则的人  孩子
I don't make the rules, son.

123
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,522
我只是负责吹哨的
I just blow the whistle.

124
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,673
同时  我还教你们生理课
Also, I teach health class.

125
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,859
所以一旦你们对自己青春期的变化有什么疑问
So if you have any questions about your changing body,

126
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,844
我的门随时为你们敞开
my door is always open.

127
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:29,698
算了吧  还是把门关了得了
Yeah, let's keep that door closed.

128
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,450
完成了
Done!

129
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,684
折返跑跑得不错啊  迪吉
Nice shuttle run, Diggie.

130
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:35,654
28.7 秒
28.7 seconds.

131
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,573
我认为这是最好成绩了  孩子
I don't think any less of you, son.

132
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,710
嘿
Hey!

133
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,695
迪吉
Diggie.

134
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,748
我最爱的校队运动员
My favorite varsity athlete

135
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:50,553
也是唯一一个从不打击贬低我的家伙
and the only one who has never purpled my nurples.

136
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:51,703
我需要你帮个忙
I need a favor.

137
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:54,473
我必须在 35 秒内跑完折返跑
I need to do the shuttle run in under 35 seconds.

138
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,591
哦  你想让我来训练你
Oh, so you want me to train you?

139
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:59,812
- 我很乐意  - 其实  我想让你当枪手来替我跑
- I'd be happy to. - Actually, I was thinking you'd do it for me.

140
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,647
我给你戴副眼镜
I'd give you some glasses.

141
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:02,815
穿上古怪的筒形袜
Some fancy tube socks.

142
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,403
乔伊  无意冒犯  但是没人会认为我就是你的
Joey, no offense, but no one's going to believe that I'm you.

143
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,555
你猜怎么着  你说的很对
You know what... you're right.

144
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,607
为何我天生就这么帅气啊
Why did I have to be born so handsome?

145
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,731
噢  嘿
Oh, hey.

146
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,568
听说你感觉不太舒服
Heard you weren't feeling very well.

147
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,902
啊  是的  大概是蠕虫病什么的吧
Oh, yeah. Must be a bug or something.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,590
唔  我希望你明天对阵灰熊队的比赛能发挥正常啊
Mm, well, I hope you'll be okay for the game against the grizzlies tomorrow.

149
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,708
我觉得经过一晚上的睡眠应该能恢复好的
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

150
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,710
嗯哼  要我给你拿点姜汁汽水么
Mm-hmm. Can I get you some ginger ale?

151
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,879
或是一些咸饼干
Or some crackers?

152
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,682
呃  不用了  我感觉挺好的
Um, no, I'm... I'm fine.

153
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,851
而且我的床在这边
I'm also over here.

154
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,519
你在找什么呢
What are you looking for?

155
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:41,887
哦
Oh!

156
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,639
有点头脑发热吧
A fever.

157
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,560
哎呀呀
Aww!

158
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,729
嘿  妈  妈
Hey, mom. Mom.

159
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,448
咋了
Hmm?

160
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,899
你在找丽芙的那双漂亮鞋子  对不
You're looking for Liv's perfect pumps, aren't you?

161
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,568
什么  才不是呢
What? No.

162
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:58,454
不  我  我根本停不住对鞋的思念
No, I... I can't stop thinking about them.

163
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,656
我想立马穿上
I want to slip 'em on.

164
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:03,542
哪怕只穿一个趾头  我就是想过过瘾
Even just a toe. I just need a taste.

165
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:07,713
呃  那个  其实高跟鞋不在这里
Mm, yeah, well, they're actually not in here.

166
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,465
我刚看见丽芙来过找了一轮了
I just saw Liv coming and looking for them.

167
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,418
所以我要是看见了的话会通知你的
So if I see them, I will let you know.

168
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,802
但是  嘿  妈妈  与此同时
But... hey, mom. In the meantime,

169
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,623
你或许应该想想你的尊严该穿在哪里
you might want to slip on a size 10 dose of dignity.

170
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:18,757
你说得对
You're right.

171
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,559
我不知道我怎么像着了魔一样
I don't know what's gotten into me.

172
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:21,844
如果你胆敢告诉丽芙我来过这儿  你就会
If you tell Liv I was here, and you will be...

173
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,846
我到底是怎么了
what's wrong with me?

174
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:32,571
嗨  宝贝们
Hi, girls.

175
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:33,822
我刚骗走了我妈
I just lied to my mom.

176
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:35,774
还是关于鞋子的
About shoes.

177
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,832
哈  而且我根本就不在乎
Ha! And I don't even care.

178
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:50,592
这就是我的储物柜啦
And this is my locker.

179
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,879
宝贝们  快躲好
Hide, girls.

180
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,881
噢  你好啊  玛蒂
Oh, hi, Maddie.

181
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,549
我很高兴看见你的感觉好多了
I'm glad you're feeling better.

182
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,801
什么  哦  对
What? Oh. Yeah.

183
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,918
好一大截了
Way better.

184
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:05,557
呃  那个  刚刚我听见两个学生
Um... Oh, wow. You know what... I hear two students

185
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,609
在拐角那儿试着处理一些情感问题呢
trying to work through an emotional issue around the corner.

186
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:08,727
我来了  让路
I'm coming. Make way.

187
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,479
心理治疗师驾到了
Therapist coming through!

188
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,531
鲁尼
Rooney.

189
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,816
你昨天怎么了
What happened to you yesterday?

190
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,534
我们本来约好一起吃冰淇淋的哟
We were supposed to meet for fro-yo.

191
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,486
但你没出现哟
You didn't show-yo.

192
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,788
俺就只能打包先走了哟
Had to get it to go-yo.

193
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,658
呃  对  你收到我的短信了吗
Uh, yeah. Didn't you get my text?

194
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,494
呃  收是收到了  但是“来不了  有事”
Well, yeah, but... "can't come. Got a thing."

195
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,497
讲得不明不白的
Is not all that informative.

196
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,799
你是不是长高了
Did you get taller?

197
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,835
不  是  也许吧
No. Yes. Maybe.

198
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,887
也许是你变高了
Maybe you're taller.

199
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,790
嘿  伙计们
Hey, guys.

200
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:39,842
玛蒂  你看起来不一样了
Maddie, you look different.

201
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:40,926
也许是你变高了
Maybe you're taller!

202
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,977
好吧
Okay...

203
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:47,983
等等  刚才那下不对劲  对不
Okay, that was weird, right?

204
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:51,770
我知道不对劲长什么样  刚才那就是了
I know weird, and that was it.

205
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,857
但她一整天都这么不对劲
But she's been acting weird all day.

206
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:56,825
她居然今天都没有晨练
She even skipped her morning workout.

207
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,660
这真不是她的风格
That's so not like her.

208
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,746
等等  你怎么知道  她都是早上 5 点就起来晨练的
Wait, how would you know? She works out at 5:00 A.M.

209
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,866
- 我一直在为你教我的折返跑复试而锻炼  - 真的吗
- I was up doing the drills you taught me for my shuttle run retest. - Really?

210
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,818
不  我当时在熬夜看神龙小说
Nope. I was up reading a book about dragons.

211
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,756
- 嘿  乔伊  - 维罗
- Hey, Joey. - Willow!

212
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,678
哇  我以前还从没见过他跑
Wow. I've never seen him run before.

213
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,931
真奇怪  我见到他他都是撒丫子跑的
That's weird. I only see him run.

214
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:26,555
好的  等我妈进来  我们该做什么呢
Okay, when my mom comes in, what are we going to do?

215
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,006
降低她的期望值
Lower her expectations.

216
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,609
正是
Exactly.

217
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,645
准备好体验一下帕克的方法发威吧
Get ready to experience the Parker way in action.

218
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,566
- 你好啊  鲁尼女士  - 哦
- Hey, Mrs. Rooney. - Oh.

219
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,684
你知道你现在有很多活要干
I know you have a lot to do around here.

220
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:42,704
我帮你把洗碗机里的碟子都拿出来了
So I unloaded the dishwasher for you.

221
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:43,956
谢谢你了  埃文
Well, thank you, Evan.

222
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,041
哦  那些碟子还都是脏的呢
Oh, but those dishes were dirty.

223
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:47,910
只不过有一点脏罢了
They seemed a little crusty.

224
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,579
不过我才不介意您怎么操持家务呢
But I'm not here to judge how you keep house, ma'am.

225
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,838
抱歉了  鲁尼女士
Sorry, Mrs. Rooney.

226
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,924
让我来帮您吧
Let me help you.

227
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,564
抱歉
Oops.

228
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,766
拜托  埃文
Come on, Evan.

229
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,768
以后做事请小心一点啊
Be a little more careful.

230
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,823
哎呀
Oops.

231
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:22,027
看来我被埃文带的也笨手笨脚的了
Looks like I caught the clumsies from Evan.

232
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,862
孩子们  停手吧
Boys, please stop.

233
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,748
我很抱歉  鲁尼女士
I feel terrible, Mrs. Rooney.

234
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:28,784
我去拿把拖把把这里收拾了吧
Let me get the broom and help clean up.

235
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,003
别别别  别帮我
No no no. Do not help.

236
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,671
这事还是我自己来比较好
I will take care of this myself.

237
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:35,757
谁的方法
What's the way?

238
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,843
帕克的方法
The Parker way.

239
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,879
有谁看见玛蒂了么
Has anybody seen Maddie?

240
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,747
比赛还有两分钟就开始了
Our game starts in two minutes.

241
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:43,882
玛蒂还没有来
Maddie's not here?

242
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,684
她可从来没有缺席过一场比赛的啊
She's never missed a game.

243
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,053
等等  要是玛蒂没有来  我就得上场了啊
Wait, if Maddie doesn't show, that means I have to play.

244
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,921
这可不能这样啊  天
That can't happen, man.

245
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,758
我本来还打算在比赛的时候把作业写了呢
During the game is when I get my homework done.

246
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,946
玛蒂今天表现的很是奇怪啊
Maddie was acting really weird today.

247
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,899
她是不是长高了
And did she get taller?

248
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,784
长高了
Taller?

249
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,570
大概长高了多少  是不是 7 公分左右
Like how much taller? Like 2 1/2 inches taller?

250
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:06,705
差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

251
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,740
她看上去变了个人似的
She just seemed different.

252
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:11,543
她居然在那咯咯笑  玛蒂才不会这么笑
She giggled. Maddie doesn't giggle.

253
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:12,744
她一直都是哼哼的
She snorts.

254
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,582
她今天整个感觉都像是由内而外透出某种光芒似的
It's like she had some kind of inner sparkle, man.

255
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,885
鞋子
The shoes.

256
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,671
我想我应该知道她在哪里了
Um, I think I know where she might be.

257
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,973
我这就去叫她
So I will just go get her.

258
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,758
嗯
Yeah.

259
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,560
你看看能不能把表演拖一会
See if you can get them to hold curtain.

260
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:32,630
天  这姑娘真心不了解运动啊
Wow, that girl really doesn't get sports.

261
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,799
好吧  小污点  该你上场了
All right, stains. You're in.

262
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,685
好吧
Fine.

263
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,692
我又不知道今天要我上场
I didn't think I was going to play today.

264
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,030
玛蒂
Maddie.

265
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,791
嘿  丽芙
Hey, Liv.

266
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,761
你来有何贵干
What are you doing here?

267
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:06,932
我来接你去参加那场比赛
Well, I'm here to take you back to the game.

268
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,768
不过这是怎么回事
But what is all of this?

269
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,887
哦  你可是说对了
Oh, you were so right.

270
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,773
我可喜欢这双鞋子了
I love these shoes!

271
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,692
哦
Oh!

272
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,010
这事情我们可以稍后再谈
Well, okay, we can talk about that later.

273
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,530
你先把这双鞋子脱了  我这就要接你去参加比赛
Just kick those off and we will get you back to the game.

274
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:22,948
噗  我才不去什么比赛咧
Pfft. I'm not going back to that game.

275
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,702
你到底是谁
Who are you?

276
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:30,572
我是一个喜欢穿高跟鞋  闪闪发亮的软妹子
I am a shoe-loving sparkly girl.

277
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,959
你要不要和我一起模仿那些超模啊
Do you want to play supermodel with me?

278
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,860
呵呵
Yeah.

279
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,797
当然了
Of course I do.

280
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,804
停  停  停  停
No no no no.

281
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,640
这  这腔调不对
This... this is wrong.

282
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:52,728
玛蒂整个失控了
Maddie was out of control.

283
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,880
呼  这个任务看来比我想象的困难多了
Whew, this was a much bigger job than I thought it was going to be.

284
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:58,883
我肯定是要找后援了
And I was definitely going to need backup.

285
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,018
不过
But first...

286
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,737
行  就一分钟
Okay, one minute.

287
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:02,821
好的
Yes.

288
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:16,349
您真的不需要我们帮什么忙么  妈
Are you sure we can't help you with something, mom?

289
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,536
哦  不  你们两个小家伙就在这里给我好好坐着
Oh, no. You boys just sit here and do not lift a finger.

290
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,321
免得又磕了碰了  把什么东西打了
You might break one of them too.

291
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:24,741
我得去处理一下后院里面那堆事情
I am going to do some yard work.

292
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,576
遵命
You're the boss.

293
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,745
任务达成
Mission accomplished.

294
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,664
帕克的方法
The Parker way.

295
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,709
这机器真赞
It's beautiful.

296
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:46,730
您在干什么呢  鲁尼女士
Um, what are you doing, Mrs. Rooney?

297
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:49,433
哦  你懂的  把这些残枝断梗的
Oh, you know, just jamming these big branches

298
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,401
塞进这台有 40 片旋转不锈钢刀片的
into this hundred-horsepower monster

299
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,438
上百马力的机器里面
with 40 razor-sharp stainless steel teeth.

300
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,610
哇
Whoa!

301
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,414
不会吧  我们能帮忙么
No way. Can we help?

302
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,701
呵呵  孩子  要是我不觉得你能把盘子放到水盆里面而不打掉
Oh, sweetie, if I can't trust you to carry your plate to the sink,

303
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,504
我怎么可能让你靠近这台机器呢
then I sure can't trust you around this bad boy.

304
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,739
此话当真
Seriously?

305
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:16,376
我没有比这更想做的事情了啊
But there is nothing I've ever wanted to do more.

306
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,464
话说  既然我这么想了  我要取消你的空手道课
You know, now that I think about it, I'm pulling you out of karate

307
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,582
我也要在你的自行车上重新装上从轮
and I'm putting the training wheels back on your bike.

308
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,771
好消息是  我帮你们买了蜡笔和安全剪刀
But the good news is... bought you some crayons and safety scissors.

309
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:30,390
就在里面  要我抱你进去么
They're inside. You want uppy?

310
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,561
做的不错啊  帕克
Nice work, Parker.

311
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,397
我们就连这个都做不成了
We got ourselves out of that one.

312
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,785
赞啊
Sweet!

313
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,653
这是那款 64 色的
It's the 64 pack.

314
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:46,790
盒子里面还有内置的卷笔刀呢
It has a sharpener built into the box.

315
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:50,410
哦  等等  你妈妈把那个也拿走了
Oh, wait. Your mom took that out.

316
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,463
耶  宝贝
Yeah, baby!

317
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,415
天  这听上去还真有趣
Man, that sounds like fun.

318
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:56,716
比这还有趣
More fun than all this?

319
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:00,637
这套里面有深棕黄色的蜡笔呢
Burnt sienna.

320
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,472
喔呼
Whoo-hoo!

321
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,624
我不敢相信她居然不让我们两个帮忙
I can't believe she's not letting us help.

322
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,560
正是
Exactly.

323
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:10,630
拜你所赐  她以后再也不会让我们做这种有趣的事情了
Thanks to you, she'll never let us do stuff like that again.

324
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,733
我们要不要击掌
Can a brother get a fist bump?

325
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:22,359
是不是说我如果什么都不做  就什么都做不成了
So if I don't ever do anything, I don't ever get to do anything?

326
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,647
这是我对帕克的方法的基本理解
It was my understanding that was the primary message of the Parker way.

327
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:31,701
看来帕克的方法误入歧途了
Well, perhaps the Parker way is misguided.

328
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:34,421
新鲜的松饼能不能让你觉得好过一点
Would fresh-baked muffins make this better?

329
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:36,423
当然
Certainly couldn't hurt.

330
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,460
好吧  乔伊  你能办到的
All right, Joey. You got this.

331
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:44,431
在这个弱不禁风的身体里面
Inside this scrawny, un-athletic, muscle-free sack of bones

332
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:46,466
是一个往返跑高手
is a natural-born shuttle runner.

333
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,718
您这么对我说我很荣幸
That means a lot coming from you.

334
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,554
但是丝毫无用啊
But it's useless.

335
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,557
我不可能在 35 秒里面跑完往返跑
There is no way I can do this in 35 seconds.

336
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:58,395
我的毕业致辞就算是泡汤了
I can kiss valedictorian a good-bye.

337
00:16:58,446 --> 00:16:59,613
老兄  你能行的
Dude, it's going to be okay.

338
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,448
你只要充分信任你的第一感觉
Just trust your instincts.

339
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,533
这个叫迪吉的兄弟多少还是有些锦囊妙计的
And know that the dig-man still has a couple tricks up his sleeve.

340
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,702
还有  你最好把鞋带系好
Also, you might want to tie your shoe.

341
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,454
啊  呵呵  是啊
Ah, pfft. Yeah.

342
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:08,738
准备好了么  乔伊
All right, Joey.

343
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,408
这是你往返跑补考的唯一一次机会
You get one last shot to pass your shuttle run.

344
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,692
好的
Okay.

345
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,579
在此之前  我有个问题
But before we do this... question.

346
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,414
- 跑  - 好的
- Go! - Okay.

347
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:19,666
不要
No!

348
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:24,537
恶心
Gross!

349
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:25,755
快跑啊  乔伊  快跑
Run, Joey, run!

350
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,374
乔伊  你想和我一起去舞会吗
Joey, you want to go to prom?

351
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,677
不  不  不  不  不
No no no no no!

352
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:36,349
25.4 秒  你打破了校记录
25.4. That's a new school record.

353
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,402
我的儿子是个运动员
My son's a jock.

354
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:42,606
我的儿子居然是个运动员
My son's a jock!

355
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:45,558
好啊
Yeah.

356
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,579
多谢了  迪吉  这事没了你成不了
Thanks, Diggie. Couldn't have done it without you.

357
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:52,582
恭喜啦  亲爱的
Congratulations, little man.

358
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,368
谢谢了
Thanks.

359
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:56,620
我已经累得跑不动了
I'm too tired to run away.

360
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:00,290
我知道
I know.

361
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:05,595
好咧  各位都准备好干预一下玛蒂的行为了
Okay, so we are all here for Maddie's intervention.

362
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,430
我们一定要让她走进这间房间的时候
It is very important that we make her feel

363
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,582
感觉到这里是一个这是一个安全
like she's walking into a room that is safe,

364
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,636
充满着爱意和支持  小污点
and loving, and supportive and... Stains!

365
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,355
我真想把你手里的袋子拍掉
I am going to slap that bag out of your hands.

366
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,592
既然你不想任何人吃为啥还要把它们拿出来
Why did you put them out if you don't want anyone to eat them?

367
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:30,770
嘿
Hey...!

368
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:33,456
嘿啊
Hey.

369
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,458
嘿
Hey.

370
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,411
你们在这干嘛
What are you guys doing here?

371
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:41,581
为什么都盯着我看
And why are you all staring at me?

372
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,551
为什么刚才维罗把前门锁了
And why did willow just lock the front door?

373
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,503
是啊  为什么呢
Yeah, why did she?

374
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:50,307
这让我有点儿紧张
It's making me nervous.

375
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:55,512
玛蒂  我们来这儿是为了谈谈你的问题的
Maddie, we are all here to talk to you about your problem.

376
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:58,481
什么问  我没有问题啊
What pro... I don't have a problem.

377
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,566
不  你有
Yeah, you do.

378
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,518
你对那些鞋子上瘾了
You're obsessed with those shoes.

379
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,353
我没有上瘾
I am not obsessed.

380
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:04,604
它们是我新的好朋友
They're just my new best friends

381
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,639
你的世界里唯一重要的东西
and the only things in the world that matter.

382
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:09,526
你以前告诉过我你多么讨厌高跟鞋
You used to tell me how you hated high heels.

383
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:12,329
我们周天的激励散步难道没有任何意义吗
Have our Sunday afternoon empowerment walk means nothing?!

384
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:14,581
呃
Okay.

385
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,700
我以前不喜欢高跟鞋  可是我现在喜欢了啊
So I used to not like them and now I do.

386
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:18,535
我说的是  一个女孩有权利改变主意
I mean, a girl has the right to change her mind

387
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:20,486
有权利改变主意了之后告诉她的朋友和家人
and also tell her friends and family

388
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,488
他们是多讨厌  别再烦一个可怜的女孩儿了
that they are annoying and should stop bothering her.

389
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:27,510
丽芙  是你告诉我去拥抱我的内在光芒的啊
I mean, Liv, you were the one who told me to embrace my inner sparkle.

390
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,763
是我说的没错  但是我发现我错了
I did, but I was wrong.

391
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,515
玛蒂  看看你  你现在的生活完全本末倒置了
I mean, Maddie, now your priorities are all out of whack.

392
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,666
你错过了一场比赛
You missed a game.

393
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,435
是啊  天  我都被逼上场了
Yeah, man. I had to play.

394
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:37,721
我进了个球  自摆乌龙
I made a basket... for the other team.

395
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,641
那我们说好去吃冰淇淋的事怎么办
And what about our fro-yo date?

396
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:45,395
玛蒂  那天冰淇淋还买一送一呢
Mads, it was two-for-one toppings night.

397
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:48,398
而且我讨厌你比我高
And I hate that you're taller than me.

398
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:51,401
这话真是出口为快
There. I said it.

399
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,686
我通过了往返跑哦
And I passed the shuttle run.

400
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:59,692
虽然和我们的对话并不相关  但我还是想说  我太自豪了
Not relevant to what we're talking about, but I'm just so proud of myself.

401
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,698
好了  伙计们  不过是一双  等等  你过了
Okay, guys, it's just a pair of... wait, hold on. You passed?

402
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,334
你知道吗  只要我想随时我都可以把它们脱下来
You know what? I can take these off whenever I want to.

403
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,502
哈
Ha!

404
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,338
好啊  那你脱啊
Okay, then do it.

405
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:16,676
恩  我说的是我想的时候
Well, I said that I can take them off whenever I want to,

406
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,562
但是我现在不想
and I just don't want to right now.

407
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,764
然后尼
So...

408
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:22,381
自己看着办吧
Deal with it.

409
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,517
噢  我们会的  大家动手啊
Oh, we will. Now!

410
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,770
迪吉  抓住她的腿
Diggie, grab her legs.

411
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:28,521
噢
Oh!

412
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:29,773
放我下来
Put me down!

413
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:33,610
这是怎  我的鞋子
Wha... my shoes!

414
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:39,749
丽芙  把我的鞋子还给我
Liv, give me back my shoes.

415
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,584
噢  松饼
Ooh! Muffins.

416
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,403
请别介意
Don't mind if I do.

417
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:45,455
丽芙  不要啊
Liv, no!

418
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:47,573
请别惩罚这双高跟鞋啊
Don't punish the pumps.

419
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:48,758
哦  相信我  玛蒂
Oh, believe me, Maddie.

420
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,628
这给我的伤害比给你的伤害多了去了
This is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going to hurt you.

421
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,713
哦  等等  我说啥来着
Oh... Wait, what am I saying?

422
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,581
难道丽芙·鲁尼能忍心
Like there's any way in the universe

423
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,767
可以毁掉一双超赞的……
that Liv Rooney would destroy the perfect pair of...

424
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,439
不
No!

425
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,391
这就结束了
It's over now.

426
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,561
一切都会好起来的
It's going to start to get better.

427
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,697
但是太难了
But this is so hard.

428
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:14,400
我的脚  要冻死了
And my feet are... So cold.

429
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:18,771
有些老朋友想打个招呼
I have a couple of old friends who want to say hi.

430
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,541
噢
Oh.

431
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:22,792
谢谢
Thank you.

432
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,577
哇
Wow.

433
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:26,713
我不知道我是怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

434
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,415
玛蒂  你找到了你的内在的光芒呀
Well, Maddie, you tapped into your inner sparkle.

435
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:32,385
是啊伙计  每个人都会这样
Yeah, man. It happens to all of us.

436
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:38,641
幸运的是  你有一个对这种闪闪发光的东西了如指掌的姐姐
Luckily, you have a sister to guide you through all things sparkly.

437
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:39,726
我们一步一步慢慢来
So we will start slow.

438
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,761
嗯  这是草莓味唇彩
Okay, this is strawberry lip gloss.

439
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,513
你可别把它吃了
Don't eat it.

440
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:49,551
给你  妈妈
Here you go, mom.

441
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:55,003
佛罗里达的橙子  刚刚榨的  杯子还是冰过的哦
Florida oranges, freshly squeezed, chilled glass.

442
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,905
我这就去烤面包
I'll go start on the croissants.

443
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,741
谢谢宝贝
