1
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:10,775
Okay, Liv and Maddie will be back from their driving test any second.

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,444
Ready to celebrate?

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,112
Check it.

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,384
Sing it loud!

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,386
Bam! What?!

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,656
Ooh, I can't wait to get my license

7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,658
and be able to go wherever I want.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
( Laughs ) Within the city limits.

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,061
Before my curfew.

10
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,031
In a beat-up minivan that smells like Joey's feet.

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,433
Still freedom.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,668
Whoo-hoo!

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,769
Freedom?

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,639
( Scoffs ) Try loss of freedom.

15
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,507
Who wants to drive when you can sit shotgun

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,109
and text until your thumbs fall off?

17
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,477
( Chuckles ) Not me.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,546
I'm stoked for Maddie. Having a license...

19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,481
that means she can go anywhere and do anything.

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,550
That a responsible teenager would do

21
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,184
after getting approval from her father.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,354
Not that I've ever asked her not to get approval.

23
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,622
Why am I still talking?

24
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,723
( Mouthing )

25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,824
Why are you in my house?

26
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,459
Why haven't you gotten a haircut?

27
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,129
We've all got questions.

28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,231
( Gasps ) There she is.

29
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,766
- ( All cheer ) - Congratulations, Liv.

30
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,235
One of our two new drivers.

31
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,770
Yes. Hold your rah-rahs.

32
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,205
Only one of us passed.

33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,174
Total bummer-rang.

34
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,776
Aw, you'll get it next time, kid.

35
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,679
No. I'm the one who passed.

36
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,481
( Laughs ) License to surprise!

37
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,851
Wait, if you passed, that means Maddie failed.

38
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,554
Maddie doesn't fail anything.

39
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,822
- Ooh! - Oh!

40
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,091
( Shouts )

41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,294
Burn it! Burn it all!

42
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,729
( All chatter )

43
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,564
Well...

44
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,733
I failed.

45
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,835
Guess I know what it feels like to be a loser now.

46
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,638
You know what I'm talking about, Joey.

47
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,842
Ouch! I would call that a drive-by...

48
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,844
if you had your license.

49
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,479
( Imitates explosion )

50
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:59,250
So what happened?

51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,752
I will tell you what happened.

52
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,587
The DMV discriminates.

53
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,756
Yeah. They only give their licenses

54
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,826
to people who can make left-hand turns.

55
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,796
They do come in handy when you want to go left.

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,499
Why would you purposefully turn

57
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,368
into oncoming traffic when you can go up one block

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,869
and make three rights?

59
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,806
Who needs their license anyway, am I right?

60
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,843
I do! I need my license!

61
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,912
Don't worry, Maddie. I'll drive you anywhere you want to go.

62
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,314
Seriously, why am I still talking?

63
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,715
Why am I still here?

64
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,250
I'll go get my hair cut.

65
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:37,455
( Theme music playing )

66
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,823
Better in stereo

67
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,892
b... b... better in stereo

68
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,927
-  I'm up with the sunshine -  Let's go

69
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,530
-  I lace up my high tops -  Oh no

70
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,365
slam dunk, ready or not

71
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,933
yeah, show me what you got

72
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,536
-  I'm under the spotlight -  Holler

73
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,538
I dare you, come on and follow

74
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,807
you dance to your own beat

75
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,809
I'll sing the melody

76
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,512
when you say yea-ah-ah

77
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,447
I say no-oh-oh

78
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,716
when you say stop

79
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,218
all I want to do is go go go

80
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,221
you you, the other half of me me

81
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,223
the half I'll never be-e

82
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,894
the half that drives me crazy

83
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,897
you you, the better half of me me

84
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,366
the half I'll always need

85
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,834
but we both know

86
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,836
we're better in stereo.

( TV playing )

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,777
Guys! I have something really exciting to say.

90
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:37,248
How about you pause your piehole for two hours?

91
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,785
We'll get to you later.

92
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,288
We're all listening, Liv.

93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,456
Okay.

94
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,624
There is a major film

95
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,493
shooting in Wisconsin this summer,

96
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,728
and I'm up for a big part.

97
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,829
How exciting! What's it about?

98
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,966
It's based on some book about wolves in space.

99
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,603
Both: "Space Werewolves!"

100
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,807
( Squeals ) That is my favorite graphic novel.

101
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,042
No way!

102
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,844
They want me to play Tristan.

103
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,480
As in Tristan Lycanth?

104
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,481
Yeah.

105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,950
The hero?

106
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,918
Ha ha, but Tristan's a boy.

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,854
Technically half-boy, half-werewolf.

108
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,923
But he is definitely not a girl.

109
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,926
Right. Not yet.

110
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,362
But the people making the movie saw my episode of Sing it  Loud!

111
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,766
right where I dreamt that I was on an international space station

112
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,367
and I saved the earth by singing the high note

113
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,469
that shattered the asteroid before it hit earth. Aah!

114
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,871
( Sings high note )

115
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,607
( Imitates explosion )

116
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,308
I love that episode.

117
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
Really? 'Cause I had some logic problems with it.

118
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,678
But you sparkled, honey.

119
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,816
They liked it so much that they're considering changing the role of Tristan

120
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,385
into a girl just for me.

121
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,722
I had to stop Liv for her own good.

122
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,624
Fanboys are crazy.

123
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,325
I should know. I'm one of them.

124
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,527
( Clicks tongue )

125
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,729
We're talking about Tristan Lycanth.

126
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,865
Keeper of the claw of freedom.

127
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,736
Does this match this?

128
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,906
( Mouthing )

129
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,010
- What's up, Diggie? - What's up, Rooney?

130
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,813
'Sup with your hair?

131
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,782
You did not get a haircut

132
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,317
just because my dad told you to.

133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,520
( Scoffs ) No. Not at all.

134
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,056
I totally needed a trim. Do you think he'll like it?

135
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,927
Diggie, you can't let him push you around like this.

136
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,595
I mean, your hair was a hot mess,

137
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,764
but that's not the point.

138
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,566
I can't help it, okay? I want him to like me.

139
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,800
He's your dad. And you and me are...

140
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,036
Whatever we are.

141
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,672
Totally. Whatever.

142
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,042
Um... you just need to find something

143
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,910
that you and my dad both like and bond over that.

144
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,512
Oh, yeah, okay, great. Let's see.

145
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,081
He likes growling at me.

146
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
You know what else he likes...

147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,117
barbecuing.

148
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,920
Grilling sure beats growling.

149
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,857
And, if he starts to like me,

150
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,358
I could help you prep for your driver's test.

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,993
Aww. ( Laughs, snorts )

152
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,495
That's so sweet.

153
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,930
- Hey, Dad. - ( Exclaims )

Dude, I'm kidding. Ha ha.

156
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,437
But he won't be.

157
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,443
Oh! Hey, Liv, you want some chocolate pudding?

158
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,445
We found a big bowl of it in the fridge.

159
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,814
Um, boys, that's not chocolate pudding.

160
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,049
That's my organic face mask from Paris.

161
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,985
Oh, ho ho ho.

162
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,754
Fancy pudding.

163
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,956
Yeah. It's made with orangutan poop.

164
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,693
( Sputters )

165
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,063
Well, whatever that monkey ate was delicious.

166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,835
Is that banana?

167
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,403
Okay, just...

168
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,805
Eww, Joey...

169
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,840
( clears throat )

170
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,141
Get this.

171
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,010
Somehow word has spread through the blogosphere

172
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,512
that I'm up for the role of Tristan in "Space Werewolves."

173
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,182
Not sure how that info leaked out onto the Internet.

174
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,451
We would never post that juicy tidbit

175
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,221
on the Stevens Point "Space Werewolves" fan page

176
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,556
in hopes of enraging local Tristanites.

177
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,791
( Laughs )

178
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,761
Liv will thank me for this later.

179
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,462
Let me guess.

180
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,564
The fanboys were none too pleased

181
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,566
about you playing Tristan.

182
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,968
You probably want to throw in the towel

183
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,070
and back out.

184
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,505
Uh, no.

185
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,973
I mean, why do I care what nerd nation

186
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,977
Because we are a powerful force to be reckoned with...

187
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,579
I mean, they are!

188
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,914
( Clears throat ) Whatever.

189
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,616
This weekend I have a personal appearance

190
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,751
at Neville's Novelty Shoppe to sign "Sing it Loud!" DVDs.

191
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,019
Why don't you guys come with me?

192
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,490
Liv, Neville's is fanboy central.

193
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,061
and then find out that you don't know what you're talking about

194
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,562
they will eat you alive.

195
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,632
He's a werewolf and he lives in space.

196
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,600
I think anything else I need to learn about him will be in here.

197
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,869
I can probably finish this by Saturday, yeah?

198
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,104
Liv, that's volume 1.

199
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,940
There are 64 volumes.

200
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,141
Hah!

201
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,910
No wonder they're making this into a movie.

202
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,778
Who would want to read all that?

203
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,917
Ugh!

204
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,685
Ugh!

205
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,022
323 pages

206
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,590
of "Rules of the Road,"

207
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,825
and not once did they admit

208
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,593
that turning left into oncoming traffic

209
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,595
is insane.

210
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,666
420 pages of werewolves and spaceships,

211
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,934
and the only thing I'm really looking is that

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,761
I think I could totally rock Tristan's space suit.

213
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,871
Yeah...

214
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,840
just wait till they get to the Battle of Mirth.

215
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,874
( Imitates gunfire )

216
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,242
That's when he meets Kytra,

217
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,910
and that's when the adventure really kicks off.

218
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,278
( Gasps )

219
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,216
You undercover Sci-Fi geek.

220
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,552
You've totally read this book.

221
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,987
Yeah, I've actually read them all.

222
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,789
I love them. And I have to admit...

223
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
I am a little on the fence about you playing Tristan myself.

224
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,595
Okay... one, how dare you.

225
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,232
And two, help me.

226
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,734
Okay, Liv, why are you wigging out?

227
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,636
Because I really want this role.

228
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,937
I mean, I know that I've been playing it cool,

229
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,939
but this is way bigger than my show

230
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,176
and it could send me into a completely new acting stratosphere.

231
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,279
I just have no idea how to impress these fanboys.

232
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,781
Okay, well, I would love to help you

233
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,682
but, Liv, my driver's test is on the same day

234
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,984
as your autograph signing.

235
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,185
And I still have no idea

236
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,587
how to make a stupid left-hand turn.

237
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,624
I have a twin-sane idea!

238
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,028
This Saturday, I'll be you and you be me.

239
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,696
- Wait, you mean like... - A switch-a-Rooney.

240
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,131
( Both scream )

241
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,868
I'll face your fanboys.

242
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,737
And I will take your driver's test.

243
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,639
Perfect! ( Laughs )

244
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,274
Why is this bed so squishy?

245
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,746
( Clears throat )

246
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,950
Because I am sitting on a pizza.

247
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,053
A girl gets hungry at 3:00 A.M.

248
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,660
( Muttering )

249
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,763
Web... and that's how I slay the dragon.

250
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,867
Hey, Artie, you got a minute?

251
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,968
Hey, Joey.

252
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,303
You got a girlfriend?

253
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,805
Burn!

254
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,176
How is that a burn? You took your mom to the freshman dance last fall.

255
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,083
So, what brings you crawling back

256
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,985
to the Society of Space... Space... space...

257
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,720
Were... were... were... Wol... wol... wol...

258
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,622
wol... wol... wol... ves... ves?

259
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,891
( Howls )

260
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,227
I was voted out of the Society

261
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,929
for suggesting that wolf tails were stupid.

262
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,631
Was I wrong?

263
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,800
People, was I wrong?

264
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,203
I want to talk to you about my sister Liv.

265
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,872
No la la la la.

266
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,007
We do not speak the name of that she-devil

267
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,676
who wants to desecrate Tristan.

268
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,044
Unless she sent you to ask me to prom,

269
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,607
in which case, let her know I say maybe.

270
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,382
Be gone with you.

271
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,684
( Yelps )

272
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,653
Listen, Artie.

273
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,155
We have a common enemy here,

274
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,789
and we need to work together

275
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,825
to defend the iconic character

276
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,094
that is Tristan.

277
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,197
We were once powerful allies, you and I.

278
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,133
An uneasy alliance.

279
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,737
My wolf ears are perked.

280
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,806
Liv will be down at Neville's tomorrow.

281
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,442
I need you to show her the real fangs

282
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,112
of a true "Space Werewolves" fanboy.

283
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,047
Fanboy?

284
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,850
That term is derogatory, sir.

285
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,054
We prefer "fantasy enthusiast."

286
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,455
So will you do it?

287
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
Oh, sounds great, Joey.

288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,228
I'd happily waltz right into your trap.

289
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,463
Do you take me for a fool?!

290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,201
Yes. Yes, I do.

291
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,272
But as Tristan himself would say...

292
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,907
( In a deep voice ) When an enemy

293
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,211
- offers his paw, lick it. - ( Mouthing along )

294
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,447
If only to tear off his hind leg...

295
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,182
Tomorrow.

296
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,052
Oh!

297
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,220
Saying no to that would be like

298
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,188
saying no to Tristan himself.

299
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,023
Well played, lone wolf.

300
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,025
Well played indeed.

301
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,094
( Howls loudly )

302
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,195
Aah!

303
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,299
Nerds!

304
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:21,973
( Blows whistle )

305
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,141
Pull over to talk or text.

306
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,946
Mmm! Gotta love a brown sugar glaze.

307
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,281
( Blows whistle )

308
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,450
No eating in the halls.

309
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,518
I can't help it, coach.

310
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
Just falls off the bone.

311
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,291
That's some solid-looking barbecue you got there.

312
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,293
Thank you.

313
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,263
I followed a recipe from "Barbecue Monthly."

314
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:50,001
Oh! Too much black pepper.

315
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,036
Ah, it was all so confusing.

316
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,372
My father's...

317
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,439
A vegetarian.

318
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,842
( Winces )

319
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,044
I just have no one to guide me.

320
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,313
Well, I don't like to brag,

321
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,982
but last summer I did win

322
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,853
the Stevens Point "Thrilla on the Grilla" cook-off.

323
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,023
Oh, yeah! Coach Rooney took the barbecue bait.

324
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,924
But seriously, not one word about the haircut?

325
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,926
What gives?

326
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,165
Hey, check it out...

327
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,067
I sold Liv's toothbrush to a "Sing it Loud!" Fan

328
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,202
and got us a bunch of gummy eyeballs.

329
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,937
( Mouths )

330
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,907
Too bad she only has one toothbrush.

331
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,944
Oh, please... I picked that one off the sidewalk out front.

332
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,215
Oh...

333
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,120
The switch-a-Rooney was on.

334
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,955
It took me four hours to do my hair

335
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,991
and Liv made me sleep with my head hanging off the mattress

336
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,459
to protect the pouf.

337
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,894
( Snorts )

338
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,363
I drooled into my own nose.

339
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,938
( Cheering )

340
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,407
( Scattered applause )

341
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,846
( Object shatters )

342
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,250
Thank you all so much for coming

343
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,586
to the season 4 DVD signing

344
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,922
of  Sing it Loud!

345
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,427
Artie's here.

346
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,364
Let the games begin.

347
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,898
Liv Rooney.

348
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
Are the rumors true that you,

349
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,170
a girl, might play Tristan Lycanth?

350
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,572
( Clicks, drops pen )

351
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,041
It's true, fanboy.

352
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,342
What say you?

353
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,912
I say it's intergalactic blasphemy!

354
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,914
And I shall prove you're unworthy.

355
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,884
Be warned my minions are live blogging.

356
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,421
King_Artie_the_magnificent @ wolfspot dot howl.

357
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,555
Ha ha.

358
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,158
Bring it on, king Artie.

359
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:58,195
Speak for Tristan's lineage.

360
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,599
Who are his parents?

361
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:07,204
Liv is about to go down in flames.

362
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,606
His parents

363
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,275
are the werewolf Magrol

364
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,411
and queen Zira.

365
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,046
Bam! What?!

366
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,117
( Laughs )

367
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,021
I mean, space-tastic question.

368
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,556
( Laughs )

369
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,092
Both: Maddie.

370
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,431
Okay, we are good to go.

371
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,132
Uh, I think we're forgetting one thing.

372
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,669
Oh! Ha ha. Yes.

373
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,938
Lip gloss.

374
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,974
No, it says here you're required to wear glasses

375
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,609
to drive.

376
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,446
( Laughs )

377
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,348
Does it say that?

378
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,051
I thought I just needed those for the picture.

379
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,553
( Both laugh )

380
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,121
Put 'em on.

381
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,160
O. M. Eyeballs.

382
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,030
Now start the car and put it in gear.

383
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,432
Absolutely. ( Laughs )

384
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,101
If you could just... Direct me to the...

385
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,270
Ignition.

386
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,606
( Laughing )

387
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,074
No?

388
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,411
( Starts ignition )

389
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,980
All right. This is good.

390
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,483
Now merge left. There's construction ahead.

391
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,985
- Uh... - Go left. I said left!

392
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,986
- ( Tires squeal ) - ( Screams )

393
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,287
Okay, too far, too far.

394
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,022
- Okay. - Garbage can.

395
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,091
- I don't... - ( Tires squealing )

396
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,759
- ( Shouts ) - ( Thuds )

397
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,328
( Horn blares )

398
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,029
Okay.

399
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,431
Pull the vehicle over.

400
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,233
Uh, uh, okay.

401
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,101
Slow down. Slow down!

402
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,269
- I'm not... I... - Mailbox.

403
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,604
- Mailbox! - What?!

404
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,405
- ( Thuds ) - ( Both scream )

405
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,075
( Airbags hiss )

406
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,580
So... ( Sighs )

407
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,649
Pass?

408
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,557
Here we are... a couple of dudes

409
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,059
getting ready to do some chillin' and grillin'.

410
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,762
Are you okay that I just called you a dude?

411
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,664
Relax, we're barbecuing.

412
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,367
Everybody's a dude.

413
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,669
Okay. Let's do this.

414
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,538
Absolutely.

415
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,140
First, I need you to do a few things.

416
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,342
Hit me. Whatever you want.

417
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,177
Shuck the corn? Season the meat?

418
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,813
Mow the lawn.

419
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,315
Um, what?

420
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,684
And clean the gutters, rotate my tires,

421
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,220
grout the tub, and empty the dishwasher.

422
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,122
Dude.

423
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:41,325
What does that have to do with barbecuing?

424
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,093
I thought you came here to learn.

425
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,828
Let me go get the lawn mower.

426
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,096
( Door opens )

427
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,765
I knew exactly what Diggie was doing.

428
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,734
Using barbecue to soften up the old man?

429
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,103
If he wanted to get on my good side,

430
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,605
he was going to have to get on the good side

431
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,408
of my to-do list.

432
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,344
Finally, a little thrilla on the grilla!

433
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,147
All those chores made me hungry.

434
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,282
( Snaps )

435
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,084
That's mine.

436
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,521
What... did you forget to bring your own steak?

437
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,858
Maybe next time.

438
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:19,863
Next time?

439
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm in! ( Laughs )

440
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,102
- ( Sizzles ) - Aah!

441
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,838
"Bring your own steak." Classic!

442
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,143
Why are you messing with that poor boy?

443
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,146
I'm just making sure he's good enough for my daughter.

444
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,148
And I'm done for the day.

445
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,851
Don't tell Maddie,

446
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,153
but except for that stupid name,

447
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,189
Diggie's all right.

448
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,794
Final question, girl.

449
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,898
When Tristan split the galactic pangaea,

450
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
what did he say to the scattering colonies?

451
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,306
"Run to the stars, wolves.

452
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,541
- ( Mouthing along ) - But always put first your families.

453
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,876
For their love

454
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,145
keeps you tethered to the universe."

455
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,716
( Sighs ) Wow. You've gotta admit...

456
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,618
Maddie's making Liv look really good.

457
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,453
She's not fooling anyone.

458
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,456
Well, except everyone here.

459
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,728
Well, Liv Rooney...

460
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,930
I'm sold.

461
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,568
I mean, you will make a great Tristan Lycanth.

462
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,706
All hail the she-Tristan!

463
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,942
( Howling loudly )

464
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,878
And, FYI...

465
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,181
I currently am available for le prom.

466
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,484
( Chuckles, roars )

467
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,919
But your window of opportunity

468
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,822
is closing.

469
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,323
Boop!

470
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,725
Artie.

471
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,527
Are you serious?

472
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,496
You can accept my sister playing Tristan?

473
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,865
What part of... ( Howls loudly )

474
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,333
Don't you understand?

475
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,904
Okay, so Parker and I are the only ones

476
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,839
that have a problem with this?

477
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,474
Um, speak for yourself.

478
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,875
She won me over too.

479
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,579
Artie, tail me.

480
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,985
( Singing stately tune )

481
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,289
( Howls )

482
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,958
( Howling )

483
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,294
It was at that moment that I realized

484
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,929
I was the crazy fanboy

485
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,597
that I was trying to protect Liv from.

486
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,933
I was untethered from my family.

487
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,901
I was the lone wolf.

488
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,239
And I should not have eaten 15 gummy eyeballs.

489
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,608
You know what, Artie...

490
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,977
tail me too.

491
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:53,517
All hail the she-Tristan!

492
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,454
( Howling )

493
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,026
Let me make one thing clear.

494
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,562
This was the last switch-a-Rooney.

495
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,930
You did it when you were 6.

496
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,332
And I wrote your names on your forehead

497
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,034
in permanent marker.

498
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,871
Don't make me do that again.

499
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,741
Ah, yes... the summer of headbands.

500
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,611
To be fair, though, we rocked the headband look.

501
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,479
( Laughs )

502
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,947
Ha ha fun fun.

503
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,950
Maddie, no license till you're 17.

504
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,952
Rock that look.

505
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,356
17?! Seriously?

506
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,557
You want to make it 18?

507
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,659
Ah, 17. Looking forward to it.

508
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,795
And Liv,

509
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,429
since you like driving so much,

510
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,331
you are now my personal chauffeur until further notice.

511
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,667
- No! - ( Laughing ) Yes.

512
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,472
There is no errand too small, no trip too far.

513
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,641
I might even have you take me down to the end of the driveway

514
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,909
just to get the newspaper.

515
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,811
I don't know.

516
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,480
That's right, girls.

517
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,749
I just dropped an atomic mom bomb.

518
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,017
Boom!

519
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,825
She can't be serious about that, right?

520
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,626
Do we seriously still get newspapers

521
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,862
delivered to our house?

522
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,399
Hey, whatever you did down at Neville's totally worked.

523
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,035
Some fanboy named lone wolf started a petition

524
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,837
to get me the role of Tristan.

525
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,072
You won over the fanboys.

526
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,507
Thank you.

527
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,044
Pretty sure lone wolf is actually lone Joey.

528
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,547
You should go thank him.

529
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,015
Wait, I thought you said that Joey

530
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,817
was the one trying to sabotage us.

531
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,120
It was a long and complicated day.

532
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,623
Got it.

533
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,960
Also I'm sorry about wrecking your driver's test.

534
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,029
Literally. Ha!

535
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,065
And I got you something.

536
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,837
You might want to return this to the... hoovers.

537
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,840
Thanks.

538
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,141
That reminds me.

539
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,811
I got you something as well.

540
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,013
One of Artie's wolf tails. Yeah.

541
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,618
Oh! Also I got you a date to the prom.

542
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,987
( Laughs ) Yeah.

543
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,422
Artie would like to know what kind of dress

544
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,926
you will be wearing... Wizard or Pegasus?

545
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:18,829
( Mouths )

546
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,935
Liv, you were absolutely right.

547
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,937
It is mind-blowing what I can accomplish

548
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,906
from the passenger seat of the car.

549
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,008
I paid a bill, ordered some cute tops,

550
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,576
and adopted a penguin.

551
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,113
