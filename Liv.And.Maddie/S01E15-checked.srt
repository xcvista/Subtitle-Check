一个新包包

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,112
还是那种短到都拉不过腰的性感内衣
Underwear that doesn't go all the way up to your waist?

5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:16,615
这是个古董级的搓衣板

6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,251
哦  真是个漂亮的玩意啊

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,996
最大的特色在于上厕所的时候

13
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,998
要坐在圆木上的深山老林么
While sitting on a log?

对头  玛蒂和我已经连续四年

00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,838
你只要在树林中搭帐篷

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,307
体验着和十九世纪先人们一样的生活
And live like people did in the 1800s.

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,652
整整一年
For the entire year.

23
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,154
只不过现在金搅子还是一幅照片
Yeah, this is just a picture

24
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,622
因为我和我妈并没赢过
'cause mom and I have never really won it.

25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,290
对啊  我们中总有一个在拿够胜利点之前
Well, one of us always seems to get leprosy

26
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,658
被裁定为得了麻风病

我可以看得到听得到你
I can see and hear you.

31
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,267
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,869
呃  这不会是你又要拖着我去的
Ugh! this isn't going to be one of those things

33
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,071
那一堆破事吧
That you drag me to, is it?

34
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,945
我们笑个啥呢
Why are we laughing?

35
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,180
我跟着你去有什么好笑的
What's so funny about me going with you?

36
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,681
你到底要不要邀请我
Are you inviting me or not?

37
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,652
丽芙  这是脏兮兮苦哈哈的野外生存
Liv, this is rough-and-tumble outdoorsy living.

38
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,353
我们当然不会邀请你了
Of course we're not inviting you.

39
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,290
她胆敢不邀请我
How dare she not invite me.

40
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,725
当然了  这活动听起来
Sure, it sounds gross

41
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,927
又恶心又脏兮兮的又愚蠢
And dirty and stupid,

42
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,328
但是她好歹要问问我啊
But she should have at least asked.

43
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,362
这样我就可以严词拒绝
Then I could have turned her down

44
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,931
并且嘲笑她了
And laughed in her face.

45
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,699
算了吧  你一天都撑不过去的
No, you wouldn't survive a day.

Will be here any minute,

154
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:29,054
而老爹表现得像他是这儿的老大一样
And dad is acting like he owns the place.

155
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,425
他貌似确实是啊
He sort of does.

156
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,360
我们需要一个能让
We need a project

157
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,497
老爹忙得不可开交的计划
That will keep dad busy.

158
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,434
你干啥呢  你知道老妈对垃圾粉碎机的严格规定的
You know how strict mom is about what goes in the disposal.

159
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,302
这么做会弄坏它的
That's gonna break it.

160
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,341
原来如此  快塞进去
Shove it in.

161
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,542
全都塞进去
Shove it all in.

162
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:07,125
爸 垃圾粉碎机好像坏了
Dad! something's wrong with the disposal.

163
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,494
快来修好它啊
You need to fix it.

164
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,496
这太妙了
This is perfect.

165
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,064
你知道吧  老爹一直是干什么事
You know how dad takes forever

166
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,600
都干到不知猴年马月的
To do pretty much anything.

167
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,402
你做了什么啊
What'd you do?

168
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,407
你知道老妈对垃圾粉碎机的严格规定的
You know how strict your mom is about what goes in the disposal.

169
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,309
这下好了
Yep.

170
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,479
这堵得死死的
It's jammed up real good.

171
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,081
但你还是能修好的  对不  爹地
You can fix it, though-- right, dad?

172
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,384
当然能了  我们的爸爸是个铁血真男儿啊
Of course he can. our father's a man's man.

173
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,586
他什么都能修好的
He can fix anything.

174
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,456
说对了  看来皮特叔叔要施展
Yeah, looks like it's time for pete

175
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,392
通管子的老身手了
To get his old plumber on.

176
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,635
欢迎光临 丽芙的粉丝们
Greetings, lovers of liv

177
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,472
和喜欢鲁尼家的人们
And all things rooney.

178
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,006
欢迎来到
Welcome

179
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,210
丽芙·鲁尼住宅游
To the Liv Rooney residential tour.

180
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,413
和礼品店
And gift shop.

181
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,684
我们必须要保持警惕  别打搅了
We must be very careful not to disturb

182
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,719
住宅里的其他成员
Any of the other residents.

183
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,387
来起步走
And we're walking.

184
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,989
继续向前走
And we're walking.

185
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,991
继续向前走
And we're walking.

186
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,401
这赚钱简直是易如反
It's like taking candy from a--

187
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,070
亚蒂
Artie.

188
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,577
抱歉我来晚了
Oh, my late arrivals.

189
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,413
欢迎来到地球上最美妙的地方
Welcome to the best place on earth--

190
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,448
昔日
The past.

191
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,553
上缴你们所有现代物品的时间到了
Time to turn in all modern-day devices.

192
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,089
噢  妈呀
Oh, dear.

193
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,758
呃...
Um...

194
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,230
你所说的“现代”到底是什么意思呢
So exactly how like "modern" are we talking?

195
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,466
因为我的手机已经挺老了
'cause, I mean, my phone's pretty old.

196
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,536
我想我大概是六个月前买的吧
I think i've had it for at least like six months.

197
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,305
可是拓荒者们没有手机  你也不能有
Well, if the pioneers didn't have it, neither can you.

198
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,447
哦对了  别忘了上缴你们的梳子
Oh, and don't forget your hairbrushes.

199
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,386
我们是拓荒者  又不是动物
We're pioneers, not animals.

200
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,189
开疆时代的妇女们会自己削多余的柴禾
On the frontier women would whittle hair-grooming tools

201
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,125
来制造梳头工具
Made out of leftover firewood.

202
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,427
梳子拿好不谢
Here's a comb.

203
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,700
我的宝贝们啊
My babies.

204
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,670
别担心  亲爱的
Don't worry, sugar.

205
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,772
每个人都是有值钱玩意的
Everyone has their price.

206
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,107
嘿 我用“老妈架子圣诞节”的签名照
How about I trade you that curling iron

207
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,376
换你的卷发棒怎么样
For a signed copy of "a very butt bomb christmas"?

208
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,448
哦 丽芙 我们要谈谈
Oh, liv, honey. we should talk.

209
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,351
我开始怀疑你是不是因为我没邀请你而不高兴了
I'm starting to wonder if you're upset that I didn't invite you.

210
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,388
你怎么可能会这么想呢
Why ever would you think that?

211
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,557
你从国家的另外一边
You brought in a substitute mom

212
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,559
带来了个冒牌妈妈
From the other side of the country.

213
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,827
这不是个明显的信号么
It's kind of a red flag.

214
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,597
哦  也许你是对的  妈妈
Oh, yeah, maybe you're right, mom.

215
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,465
也许我确实有点不高兴
Maybe I am a little bit upset.

216
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,402
也许我现在要在你的比赛里打败你了
Maybe now I will beat you at your own game.

217
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,238
引用拓荒者们的话就是
As the pioneers would say,

218
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,673
愿君祥瑞
I bid you good day.

219
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,350
这改变不了什么
This changes nothing!

220
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,625
这边走  妹子们
Right this way, ladies.

221
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,561
现在往左看  这次游览的重头戏
And now to our left, the highlight of the tour.

222
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:34,132
丽芙·鲁尼的闺房
Liv rooney's sleeping chamber.

223
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,502
请不要越过房间属于丽芙的那头
Please do not disturb liv's side of the room.

224
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:41,239
但是没啥名气的她双胞胎的床就随便站
But feel free to stand on the un-famous twin's bed

225
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,507
还能照张相
And take a picture.

226
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,415
这和我想象的别无二致
It's exactly how I imagined it.

227
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,487
当代的都市公主啊
Urban princess contemporary.

228
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,725
花多少钱能让我过了这条鹅绒围栏
How much to get me past the velvet rope?

229
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,762
抱歉  亚蒂
Sorry, Artie.

230
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:04,896
这是禁止入内的
That is off-limits.

231
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,364
10 美元
10 bucks.

232
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,200
能让我享受一下明星风范的话给你 20 美元
I'll give you 20 if I can have a diva moment.

233
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,604
成交
Deal.

234
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,305
我很想开开眼
I really want to see this.

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,614
你确定这是个好主意么
Are you sure this is a good idea?

236
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,383
帕克  我认为这一切都不是个好主意
Parker, I'm not sure any of this is a good idea.

237
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,522
预备
Ready?

238
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,903
丽芙与亚蒂要白头偕老
Liv and artie forever!

239
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,739
我实在是太想取笑一下了
I really want to make fun of that.

240
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,975
但是那确实是才气不浅啊
But it was nothing short of magnificent.

241
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,383
我们已经努力了三个小时了
We have been at this for three hours.

242
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,485
搅拌奶油到底要多长时间啊
How long does it take to churn butter?

243
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,487
很明显至少要花三个小时
Well, obviously it takes at least three hours!

244
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,758
我很抱歉  布丽  我只是
I'm sorry, Bree, I just...

245
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,561
我真的很想要那些树皮做的项链玩意儿
I really want one of those bark necklace thingies.

246
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,463
好了  我们来看看
Okay, let's check.

247
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,507
哈  哈  给你们看看  女士们
Ha ha! in yo face, ladies!

248
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,714
你 你看见那个了 对不
You-- you saw that, right?

249
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,282
我们还能够记上分么
We're still going to get credit for that?

250
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,451
不能
No.

251
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,322
但是伐木比赛又诞生了一个赢家哦
But we do have a winner in the wood-chopping competition.

252
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,691
祝贺鲁尼队
Congratulations, team rooney!

253
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,359
太好了
Yes!

254
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,498
伐木的秘诀就是痛恨那块木头
The secret is to really hate the wood.

255
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,034
妈
Mom.

256
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,669
今年终于属于我们了
This is finally our year.

257
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,471
我的意思是  我们这么领先
I mean, we are so far ahead,

258
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,774
都已经拿定那个金搅子了
We've got that golden butter churn all locked up.

259
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,542
但是  除非我们干了什么傻事
Well, unless we do something dumb--

260
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,577
我说的我们  是指你  所以最好什么都别碰
And by we, I mean you-- so don't touch anything.

261
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,847
嘿  听着你说呢  妈妈
Hey, I hear you, mom.

262
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,750
所以这里
So here...

263
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,521
就是通往金搅子的大道
Is to the golden butter churn.

264
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,589
玛蒂·鲁尼
Maddie rooney.

265
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,691
你是不是刚刚喝了一口又绵又滑的白水
Did you just take a nice, long drink of water

266
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,893
来防止脱水呢
To avoid dehydration?

267
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,061
对的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,563
那么你就死掉啦
Then you're dead.

269
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,802
呃 什么 这
Uh-- wha-- uh...

270
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,403
等一下 先别
Wait, hold on.

271
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,504
我煮沸了这水啊
I boiled this water.

272
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,007
不不不不  你煮的是那桶水
No no no no. you boiled that water.

273
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,009
啧啧
Oops!

274
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,313
但我们今年势在必得啊
But we were going to win this year.

275
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,448
把死人抬出去
Bringing out the dead!

276
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,519
这  不  妈妈  我都是很小心的
Wha-- no, mom, I have been so careful.

277
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,555
你懂得  我们那么领先
You know what-- we are so far ahead,

278
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,691
你单枪匹马就能把金搅子赢回来
You win that golden butter churn for both of us!

279
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,092
你要让梦想成真啊
You keep this dream alive!

280
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,398
把尸体准备展览吧
Let's prepare the body for the viewing.

281
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:59,103
奇异恩典
amazing grace

282
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,606
何等
how sweet...

283
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,544
之后丽芙的角色就说
And then Liv's character was like,

284
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,779
哦不  你可没这么干
"oh, no, you didn't!"

285
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,980
之后那个坏女孩就说
And then the bad girl was like,

286
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,114
哦是的  我就这么干了
"oh, yes, I did."

287
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,717
之后她们怒气冲冲的来了一场舞蹈比赛
And then they had an angry dance-off.

288
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,820
就像是
It was like--

289
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,922
亚蒂  亚蒂  亚蒂  亚蒂
Artie. artie. artie! artie!

290
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,424
你够了
That is enough.

291
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,592
下床去
Get off the bed.

292
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,995
好吧
Fine.

293
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,364
之后她们化解恩怨  成了对好朋友
And then they made up and became best friends.

294
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,535
好了 同志们
All right, people.

295
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,071
请把注意力集中到窗台上
Please direct your attention to the window seat,

296
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,939
你们能看到很多丽芙
Where you will find every stuffed animal

297
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,441
从小到大玩过的毛绒玩具
Liv has ever played with.

298
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,142
这些都是可供购买的
Also available for purchase.

299
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,679
我还要花钱买那些我送她的吗
Do I have to pay for the ones I gave her?

300
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,549
你只要不把从她桌子底下
I'm not answering that question

301
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,050
抠来的口香糖吐出来
Until you've returned the gum

302
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,052
我就不回答你的提问
You took from under her desk.

303
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,430
嘿  孩子们  你们在楼上么
Hey, boys, you up there?

304
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,199
老爸来了  大家快躲起来
Dad's coming. everybody hide!

305
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,601
我指的是躲到鞋橱里
I mean, to the shoe closet.

306
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,870
好了  同志们
All right, people.

307
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,473
起步转移  继续转移
And we're moving. and we're moving.

308
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,641
转移速度快点
And we're moving faster.

309
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,176
都赶快躲进去啊
So that means move faster.

310
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,149
嘿  你们俩在丽芙和玛蒂的房间里干嘛
Hey, what are you doing in Liv and maddie's room?

311
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,552
我们只是太想念她们了
We just miss them so much.

312
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,057
还有那堆阁楼里的毛绒玩具是怎么回事
And why are their stuffed animals down from the attic?

313
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,728
我们也太想念它们了
We missed them too.

314
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,033
那台垃圾粉碎机彻底坏了
Well, the garbage disposal's fried.

315
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,602
我要去五金店买一台新的
I have to go to the hardware store to get a new one.

316
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,471
果然  你确实是铁血真男儿啊
Yeah, you're a real man's man.

317
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,540
我先离开一会儿
I'll see you later.

318
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,042
对了  帮我个忙
Hey, do me a favor.

319
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,810
把那些毛绒玩具都放回阁楼
Put those stuffed animals back in the attic.

320
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,812
它们挺吓人的
They're creepy.

321
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,921
哦  谢谢帮忙挑水  丽芙
Oh, thanks for fetching the water, liv.

322
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,691
你错过了一个美好的早晨
You missed a wonderful wake.

323
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,529
好了  现在玛蒂那组已经出局了
Yeah, and now with Maddie out of the game,

324
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,231
我们也许真的有击败妈妈的好机会
We might actually have a chance at beating mom.

325
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,100
她没必要把所有的柴禾都
She did have to trade in all her firewood

326
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,802
换成葬花啊
For funeral flowers.

327
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,571
噢  布丽
Oh, Bree.

328
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,006
我真为我们感到骄傲
I am so proud of us.

329
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,108
我是说  一开始  我们无中生有
I mean, first, we create butter out of nothing

330
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,044
就制成了奶油
But thin air.

331
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,580
呃  好吧  五加仑的牛奶和三小时的苦工
Okay, well, five gallons of milk and three hours of labor,

332
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,916
但是仍然  我们制成了奶油
But still-- we made butter.

333
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,619
而现在我们要把衣服弄得
And now we are getting our clothes

334
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,622
一尘不染
Squeaky clean...

335
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,259
而不花分毫
With nothing...

336
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,228
除了脏石头
But dirty rocks...

337
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,064
和把我皮肤伤得不浅的肥皂
And soap that I'm pretty sure is burning my skin off.

338
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,267
让我自己这么说吧
And if I do say so myself,

339
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,570
我弄了把有老妈架子的
I have dropped a butt bomb

340
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,505
原木梳子
Of pioneer mom on this here log comb.

341
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,608
哎呀
Ow!

342
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,778
哎呀
Ow!

343
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,281
我其实休息了一小会
I actually took a little break

344
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,816
把我的脚丫子放到溪水里
And cooled my toes off in the stream,

345
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,785
然后提神到让我的脚像被刺了一样
And it was so refreshing that it made my feet tingle.

346
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,687
真是爽啊
You go, girl!

347
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,556
那是蚂蟥吗
Are those leeches?

348
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,027
蚂蟥  活生生的蚂蟥
Leeches! real, live leeches!

349
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,995
快把那些吸血鬼弄走啊
Get these bloodsucking slugs off of me!

350
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,663
布丽  别愣着不动
Bree, do something!

351
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,132
快放开她  蚂蟥们
Get off her, leeches!

352
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,801
快走  快走
Shoo! shoo!

353
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,569
得了吧  布丽
Come on, Bree.

354
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,671
这就是你该搭个老妈架子的地方
This is where you drop a butt bomb of mom on it.

355
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,774
哦  宝贝  我又不是你亲妈
Oh, honey, I'm not your mom.

356
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,542
别做傻事哦
Don't take this the wrong way.

357
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,877
我先走一步了
But I'm out of here.

358
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,113
难道还有不傻的事可做吗
Is there a right way to take that?

359
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,826
我们游览的终点站是
And as we conclude the tour...

360
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,962
吼吼吼  这个景点太稀有了
Ooh hoo hoo, this is a rare sight.

361
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,031
丽芙·鲁尼的亲爹啊
Liv rooney's real-life father.

362
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,767
别打扰他
Don't disturb him.

363
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,235
我们从后门出去
We'll go out the back.

364
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,004
才没门呢
No way.

365
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,972
我买的是全票
I was promised a full tour.

366
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,008
我的贺卡上要印上我在这里
My holiday card will have a picture of me

367
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,743
每个房间拍的照片
In every room in this house.

368
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,711
好吧
Fine.

369
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,313
请稍等片刻
Just wait here one second.

370
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,282
顺便说一句  我恨死你了
Also, I hate you.

371
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,985
你好啊  老爸
Hey, pops.

372
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,187
你在忙乎什么呢
Whatcha up to?

373
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,621
我去五金店的时候
While I was at the hardware store,

374
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,889
顺便买了个报警系统
I picked up an alarm system.

375
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,625
我们家里有个大明星
We have a celebrity living in this house.

376
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,727
会有人花钱来参观的
People would pay to get in here.

377
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,263
赞  给我好好讲讲吧
Fascinating. show me everything.

378
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,799
别将目光从操作板上移开
Don't take your eyes off this box.

379
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,771
我从来没像今天这样对你在干的活这么感兴趣
I've never been more interested in anything you've ever done.

380
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,906
别动啊  乔伊
Hold still, joey.

381
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,374
我在设置动作探测器
I'm setting the motion detector.

382
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,945
任何动作都会触发报警器
Any movement will trip the alarm.

383
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,248
警报启动
Alarm activated.

384
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,783
检测到 12 个入侵者
12 intruders detected.

385
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,818
这到底是什么破玩意
What's wrong with this thing?

386
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,254
呃  我知道咋回事了
Well-- well, I know.

387
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,356
我太激动了  动作根本停不下来
Just so excited I can't stand still.

388
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,995
警报取消
Alarm deactivated.

389
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,663
屋内安全
house secure.

390
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,866
我好像之前跟你们说过把那些吓人的玩意
I thought I told you to put those creepy things

391
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,134
放回到阁楼里去
Back up in the attic.

392
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,404
我记得我好像放过了
I thought I did.

393
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,207
你总不会认为它们是自己闹鬼走到这里来的吧
You don't think they came down on their own, do you?

394
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,412
当我放声高唱
if I sing about leeches

395
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,148
蚂蟥就会自行退散
maybe they'll go away, la la la

396
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,416
啦啦啦啦啦啦蚂蟥退散了
la la la la la la leeches!

397
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,823
快走掉啊  蚂蟥们
Get off me, leeches.

398
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,194
我刚看见布丽顺着大路一边叫一边跑我就知道你出事了
I just saw Bree running and screaming down the trail.

399
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,664
呃  我不明白你为何会这么想
Well, I can't imagine why you would think that.

400
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,332
我简直是好的不得了啊
I have never been better.

401
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,168
我被蚂蝗叮上了  妈  我腿上都是蚂蟥
I have leeches, mom. i've got the leeches.

402
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,404
哦  对  你确实腿上都是蚂蟥
Oh, yes, you have leeches.

403
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,139
但是  你很幸运
Well, lucky for you,

404
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,441
每个好妈妈都会随身携带信用卡
Every good mom keeps a credit card handy

405
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,243
来预防紧急情况
In case of an emergency.

406
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,014
呃
Ugh.

407
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,950
这是另一个喜爱信用卡的理由啊
Yet another reason to love credit cards.

408
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,457
当年的女性是不会有信用卡的
Pioneer women did not carry credit cards.

409
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,029
你被取消资格了
You are disqualified.

410
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,299
请交出你的软帽吧
Please surrender your bonnet.

411
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,367
哦  不  妈妈
Oh, no, mom!

412
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,469
你的软帽发型太可怕了
You have horrible bonnet-head.

413
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,207
她说的没错
Oh, she's not wrong.

414
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,841
你看起来跟头野牛似的
You look like a bison.

415
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,379
那么 丽芙
Well, liv,

416
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,015
你是鲁尼家最后一个还在坚持的了
You are the last Rooney standing.

417
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,717
我对你骄傲极了
I couldn't be prouder of you.

418
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,419
你是我们中把金搅子
You're our last chance

419
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,254
带回家的最后希望了
To bring home the golden butter churn.

420
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:27,191
我才不在乎什么破金搅子呢
I don't care about some stupid golden butter churn.

421
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,327
我只是想和我的妈妈多呆呆
I just wanted to spend time with my mom.

422
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,395
哦 谢谢了
Oh, thank you.

423
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,897
你口中的妈妈指的是我  对吧
You are talking about me, right?

424
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,801
我想我只是有点嫉妒
I guess I just got a little bit jealous

425
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,302
你和玛蒂的母女时刻罢了
With all of you and maddie's mother-daughter time,

426
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,171
我也想拥有一些
And I just wanted some for me.

427
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:44,141
顺带一提  我可从没玛蒂的腿上刮过蚂蟥
I never scraped leeches off of maddie's legs.

428
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,812
谢谢你照顾我
Thanks for taking care of me.

429
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,514
你才是个实打实的好妈妈
You are one butt bomb of mom.

430
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,753
我终于把这老娘的架子给夺回来了
Mama got her butt bomb back.

431
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,122
砰 搭好了
Boom! dropped.

432
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,362
你们不会知道洗个澡是多爽的
You have no idea how good it feels to be clean.

433
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,930
你要加力擦洗
You have to work extra hard

434
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,132
才能把蚂蟥的粘液从你指头上洗掉
To scrub leech slime off of your fingers.

435
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,203
欢迎回家 妈妈
Well, welcome home, mom.

436
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,371
当你出门的时候
While you were away,

437
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,507
爸爸干了些很男子汉的事情
Dad did some manly things.

438
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,144
包括升级了你的垃圾粉碎机
Including upgrading your garbage disposal.

439
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,446
- 你是不是把它弄坏了  - 别跑题了
- you broke it, didn't you? - not the point.

440
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,815
皮特 你确定你知道
Pete, are you sure you know how

441
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,317
怎么安装垃圾粉碎机么
To install a garbage disposal?

442
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,953
别跑题了
Not the point.

443
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,388
你应该试试  用的可顺手了
You should try it. it works great.

444
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,023
我们把冰箱里连帕克都不吃的剩菜
We tested it with all the leftovers in the fridge

445
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,058
都拿来做测试了
That we couldn't even get parker to eat.

446
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,981
这就是为什么我对丢进粉碎机
This is why we have strict rules

447
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,283
的剩饭剩菜有严规戒律
About what goes into the disposal.

448
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,592
我不得不佩服你 哥们
I got to hand it to you, munch.

449
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,528
你想出来了个疯狂的主意
You came up with a ridiculous idea

450
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,596
而且让它还奏效了
And you made it work.

451
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,533
最好的是压根没人发现
The best part is nobody found out.

452
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:21,405
你们俩干的事被我发现了
You two are so busted.

453
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,874
太对不住了  我们本该
We're sorry. we should--

454
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,379
你到底知道了些什么
What do you know?

455
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:32,016
噢  你们直接侵犯了我的地盘

如果你们要拿我最爱的梳子

去梳小丑的假发

至少要刷完后把恶心的橙色头发

459

都清除掉
When you're done.

对的 被你发现了

我们确实偷了你的梳子去梳小丑的假发套
We were stealing brushes and combing clown wigs
